The focus of this course is programmatic logic with a secondary focus on syntax. This course uses JavaScript as a language/syntax and Node.js as an environment to run JavaScript outside of a web browser. The skills learned in this course directly translate to other programming languages. While client-facing G raphical U ser I nterfaces (GUIs) are recommended as extended practice, there is no need for a student to worry if they are unable to build a GUI for every one of their terminal-based applications(CLI). In this course, students get a real chance to develop their own problem-solving strategies. There is no one right way to do any of them. In addition, the skills learned in this course directly translate to the skills learned in the 311 and 411 courses in a more practical and realistic sense. Instead of learning various methods, programming patterns, and data manipulation in isolation, students will spread their understanding and familiarity with programming over the development of their graduation app in the following 311 and 411 courses. Our philosophy is \"learn by doing\". We engage our students in the problem solving process as opposed to relying heavily on lectures. Our instructors, who are real developers, facilitate learning through guiding your progress as you work through projects on your own. To be successful in this course, you must spend 10-15 hours outside of class completing Pre-Class Lessons before each Class Lesson. Our class structure follows the flipped classroom model where students learn on their own outside of class and bring their questions with them to class. Class begins by discussing the \"Questions for Discussion & Terms to Know\", and the majority of class time is spent working on projects. READ ON, start with Pre-Course Pt 1: How to Succeed and work through all 5 sections BEFORE you come to class on the first day! Class Structure and Expectations This class will follow a Flipped-Classroom methodology. This means you, the student, are required to complete the assigned Pre-Homework before each day of class. You will not succeed in this course if you don't complete the Pre-Homework. Working on the Pre-Homework during class takes away from other students, ruins your chance to deeply understand the material, and ask import questions! Don't be the guy! Due dates : Homework is due the Sunday after it is assigned. (unless otherwise specified). Please have your assignment turned in by the end of Sunday night. Due dates are scheduled on Sunday for you to attend Study Sessions on the weekend. GET IT DONE! Both Daily and Checkpoint Assignments are due the Sunday after they are assigned, the Submission Due Day , i.e. Ticket-Counter is assigned Wednesday and will be due for submission 4 days later on Sunday. Assignments turned in after the Submission Due Day will be penalized with -20 points, in other words, only a maximum grade of 80 is possible. The third Checkpoint for each course, (101 - 411) will be due the Sunday following the last day of the course. Work turned in after this will be subject to -20 penalty. The Final Submission Day for any late assignments is the Second Sunday after each course ends. Assignments turned in after the Final Submission Day will receive an automatic grade of 50. Homework submission : Turn in your homework on Campus Manager. Copy/paste a link to your completed assignment(GitHub Pull Request or repo URL) in the designated spot for the assignment. For assignments that cannot be accessed via link, we'll make other arrangements on a case-by-case basis. Homework guidelines : Your work should be thorough and demonstrate an understanding of the topic and tasks set forth. Please make sure that your assignments are detailed with comments, inclusive of all specifications, and complete. Grading : You Instructor will be grading your assignments based on their functionality and completion of the specifications laid out for each assignment. Late policy : You may receive up to a 70 for an assignment that is turned in late. It is up to you, the student, to request the instructor grade the assignment after you have submitted it. Additionally, if you have 3 late or missing assignments in a row, you'll be asked to read a programming-related article of your choice and make a 3-minute presentation about it to the class. Exceptions : If you need to turn in an assignment late or will be tardy/absent to a class please email your Instructor and Campus Director ahead of time to make appropriate arrangements. To Pass This Class (and all others) Finish with a grade average of >70, Attend class 80% of the time, Complete your Final Checkpoint, Present to the class specs for the app you are planning to build for your Capstone Project.

Help yourself by following these steps to attack the problem, work through the problem and collaborate with your interviewer (instructor): How to Solve Your Challenge Restate the question aloud. Write the question out at the top of the whiteboard. Ask any clarifying questions you need. Invoke the function and write out the expected output given the sample input. If none is given, make it up. Write out a code plan to the side of the whiteboard. Speak aloud every thought you have. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART! Build the structure of your function(s). Slowly work through your code plan, building the steps you need. Don't be afraid to mess up and say it aloud. It's not about finding the solution.

The Prompts Class 1 Prompt: Two Eggs & 100 Floors - The following is a description of this famous puzzle involving 2 eggs and a building with 100 floors. Suppose that we wish to know which stories in a 100-story building are safe to drop eggs from, and which will cause the eggs to break on landing. What strategy should be used to drop eggs such that the total number of drops in the worst case is minimized and we find the required floor? 1 2 3 4 5 6 > We may make a few assumptions: > - An egg that survives a fall can be used again. > - A broken egg must be discarded. > - The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs. > - If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor. > - If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall. Class 2 Prompt: Hourglasses Puzzle - How do you measure 9 minutes from a 4 minute-glass and a 7 minute-glass? 1 > We have only 2 sand timers: 4 minutes and 7 minutes but we need to measure 9 minutes. How do we do it? Class 3 Prompt: Take an array of numbers, raise each number by the power of two and return the sum of the new array. 1 2 3 4 5 ```javascript const myArr = [ 1, 2, 3] sumOfPoweredByTwo(myArr) // --> 14 ``` Class 4 Prompt: FizzBuzz - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print \"Fizz\" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print \"Buzz\". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print \"FizzBuzz\". Class 5 Prompt: isUnique - Write a function that determines if a string contains all unique characters. Class 6 Prompt: wordLength - Build a program to find the length of the longest word in a string excluding punctuation and removing whitespace. 1 2 3 4 5 ```javascript const myString = \"This is for your own personal journey. May you have excellent navigation as a developer using your own compass.\" findLongestWord(myString) => 'navigation', 10 ``` Class 7: Prompt 1: sortedScores - Return unsorted scores in a descending sorted array. 1 2 3 /*Example*/ const unsortedScores = [ 37 , 89 , 41 , 65 , 91 , 53 ] sortedScores ( unsortedScores ) => [ 91 , 89 , 65 , 53 , 41 , 37 ] Prompt 2: float precision What will be the output of this code? console.log(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3); Class 8: Prompt 1: reverseArray - Build a function that takes in an array and returns it in reverse order. Prompt 2: duplicate - make this work duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5] Class 9: Prompt 1: powOfTwoSumEven - Given an array of numbers, raise each number by the power of 2 and return the sum of all the numbers that are evenly divisible by 4, i.e. const myArr = [1, 5, 10, 4, 2] // => 120 Prompt 2: Function Currying - How would you make the following work? What's the utility of it? 1 2 add ( 2 , 5 ); // --> 7 add ( 2 )( 5 ); // --> 7 Class 10: Prompt 1: isPalindrome Build a function that would determine if a string was a palindrome. Prompt 2: Method Chaining What value is returned from the following statement? \"i'm a lasagna hog\".split(\"\").reverse().join(\"\"); Class 11: Prompt 1: inPlaceMoveZeros Given an array nums , write a function to move all 0s to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-0 numbers: 1 2 Input: [0,1,0,3,12] Output: [1,3,12,0,0] Prompt 2: Questionable Value What is the value of window.foo?

The goal of Checkers is to remove all your opponent's pieces from the board. Your pieces can only move forward one tile diagonally (they always stay on the color of tile they started on.) To capture an opponent's piece and remove it from the board, you need to \"jump\" over their piece with one of yours. Jumping is mandatory, which means you have to jump with one of your pieces if you are able to. Try to force your opponent to make a jump and put them in a bad position! If one of your pieces gets to the opposite side of the board (your opponent's back row), it will turn into a King. Kings can move and jump diagonally in any direction (remember, your regular pieces can only move forward). Kings can even combine jumps forward and backward on the same turn! You win by removing all of your opponent's pieces from the board, or if your opponent can't make a move. In your terminal app you will create create a board with an array or arrays then place \"markers\" for your checkers\" then with the input of the user take in coordinates from where the checker starts to where the user wants the checker to go. Then you will add in logic to see if the move is legal. Then you will figure out how to remove a checker if it's jumped. How to Play Checkers How Clone the Checkers Repo Create a new branch called \"checkers\" Use this guide to Whiteboard -> Code Plan -> Psuedo Code -> Place your code in the /05week/checkers.js file in your workbook. Get to Coding!! Build the Board Class The Board() function will print the a graph representation of the board with or without checkers on it. One approach could be to generate a grid = [] variable of the appropriate size. Then loop through the list of checkers in the board, and fill in the appropriate symbols in the correct cells. Once the grid is filled out, then we can loop through the grid rows and cols to print out the grid. A board with no checkers would look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Let's create some checkers! In your Board constructor, create an attribute called Checkers and assign it to an empty list. This will be your repository of checker pieces. The Board constructor should generate 12 white pieces and 12 black pieces at the following initial positions. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 White positions: [0, 1], [0, 3], [0, 5], [0, 7], [1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 6], [2, 1], [2, 3], [2, 5], [2, 7] Black Positions: [5, 0], [5, 2], [5, 4], [5, 6], [6, 1], [6, 3], [6, 5], [6, 7], [7, 0], [7, 2], [7, 4], [7, 6] After instantiating each checker add it to the list of checkers held by the board.

For example, Wikipedia would become Ikipediaway (taking the 'W' and 'ay' to create a suffix). The objective is to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot or jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin. 1 toPigLatin ( \"Pig Latin\" ) // => Igpay Atinlay Today you're going to build the logic for this fun little program. Demo - Pig Latin Translator Students will build the Pig Latin application using the Pig Latin Repo starter code . Why do we need to fork? Why do we need to run npm i ? The basic idea of Pig Latin is to take the first letters of a word up to the first vowel, move them to the end of the word, and add 'ay' to the end of it. Below we see a function called pigLatin that gets multiple words passed into it as arguments. The // ---> represents what the function will return with the given parameter. 1 2 3 4 pigLatin ( 'car' ) //=> 'arcay' pigLatin ( 'create' ) //=> 'eatecray' pigLatin ( 'pony' ) //=> 'onypay' pigLatin ( 'egg' ) //=> 'eggyay' Use a whiteboard to plan how Pig Latin works before building it with code.

For example, Wikipedia would become Ikipediaway (taking the 'W' and 'ay' to create a suffix). The objective is to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot or jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin. 1 toPigLatin ( \"Pig Latin\" ) // => Igpay Atinlay Today you're going to build the logic for this fun little program. Demo - Pig Latin Translator Students will build the Pig Latin application using the Pig Latin Repo starter code . Why do we need to fork? Why do we need to run npm i ? The basic idea of Pig Latin is to take the first letters of a word up to the first vowel, move them to the end of the word, and add 'ay' to the end of it. Below we see a function called pigLatin that gets multiple words passed into it as arguments. The // ---> represents what the function will return with the given parameter. 1 2 3 4 pigLatin ( 'car' ) //=> 'arcay' pigLatin ( 'create' ) //=> 'eatecray' pigLatin ( 'pony' ) //=> 'onypay' pigLatin ( 'egg' ) //=> 'eggyay' Use a whiteboard to plan how Pig Latin works before building it with code.","title":"Creation Time, 60-90 minutes"},{"location":"module-1/class-3/#additional-resources","text":"Video - Coding Pig Latin","title":"Additional Resources"},{"location":"module-1/class-3/#push-yourself-further","text":"Compartmentalize your code into individual functions Minimize redundancy: D.R.Y. up your code.

Using conditionals within functions we can return or do something entirely different based on the results of the comparison. Check it out! If we asked our friend Dave to check on two buckets that are catching water from a leaky roof: \"Dave, could you check bucket \"x\" and \"y\"? If \"x\" is more full dump it out, else, dump out \"y\" and tell me how much is in each bucket afterwards. Translated into JavaScript it would look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 const bucketX = 18 const bucketY = 20 // declare a function that takes in two parameters (buckets of water) const checkWater = ( x , y ) => { // compare the two values if ( x > y ) { // if x is greater, set x to equal 0 x = 0 } else { // else, if y is greater, set y to equal 0 y = 0 } // return the values to us. return \"the value of x is: \" + x + \" and the value of y is: \" + y } // invoke the function and pass the two arguments checkWater ( bucketX , bucketY ) RUN IT! Copy/paste this code in a new Repl.it and play with it for yourself! How Conditionals To use conditionals, we simply put them into a conditional statement like an if/else statement that asks \"Is this comparison true or false ?\". Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 if ( 6 === 6 ) { return \"yes six equals six.\" } else { return \"Nope, those are not equal.\" } // if we ran the code block we would get a return of \"yes six equals six.\" because, of course, 6 does equal 6. if ( 6 === 7 ) { return \"yes six equals six.\" } else { return \"Nope, those are not equal.\" } // But if we ran this code block we would get: \"Nope, those are not equal.\" You see, an if/else statement asks if a condition is true and, if so, do the first thing, else do the second thing. More Conditional Demos An if/else statement will run a block of code if what we evaluate in the evaluation parentheses evaluates to truthy; else do what's in the else statement. Below we see the double-pipes to see if either of the operands is truthy. Literally: is input1 or input2 truthy? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 const input1 = 88 ; // truthy const input2 = 0 ; // falsey if ( input1 || input2 ) { return true } else { return false } // return true And here we see that we can use the double-ampersand to ask if BOTH input1 and input2 are truthy. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 const input1 = 'hello' ; // truthy const input2 = null ; // falsey if ( input1 && input2 ) { return true } else { return false } // returns false Let's use our typeof operator: The if statement performs a specified operation if the condition you provide is \"truthy\" . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 const name = 'jerry' ; const number = 10 if ( typeof name === string ) { console . log ( ` ${ name } is a string.` ); } else { return false } // will return false if ( typeof name === number ) { console . log ( ` ${ name } is a string.` ); } else { return false } Above we see the use of template literals as in: ${name} is a string . This is just a simple way to add values of constants with strings like: \"is a string.\" We could use concatenation like this: name + \" is a string\" , but it's much easier to use template literals. For now, you can do whichever is easier for you. If the condition is \"falsey\" , an alternative operation can be specified with an optional else clause . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 const name = 'elaine' ; if ( typeof name === string ) { console . log ( `The type of 'name' - ${ name } - is a string.` ); } else { console . log ( `'name' is not a string - it is a ${ typeof name } ` ); } Multiple else statements : You can also provide one or more alternatives that perform conditional evaluations using else if : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 // this is a handy way to get a random whole number const number = parseInt ( Math . random () * 100 , 10 ); if ( number < 10 ) { console . log ( `The 'number' - ${ number } - is less than 10.` ); } else if ( number > 11 && number < 20 ) { console . log ( `The 'number' - ${ number } - is less than 20, but greater than 11.` ); } else { console . log ( `The 'number' - ${ number } - is greater than 20, but less than 100.` ); } Above we see the use of parseInt() which is a built-in method in JS we can use whenever we need a whole number. We also see Math and .random() which generates a random decimal number. Go to the MDN docs on parseInt() and Math.random() and explain the following: Why do you think we multiply it by 100? Can you explain why number is always going to be less than 100? Also, what does the 10 being passed to parseInt do? Alternatives to Conditional Statements Switch Statement (optional alternative to if/else) Switch statements can sometimes be used to more concisely express conditional operations. A switch statement is used if you are only evaluating the value of one constant. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 const numbers = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]; const randomIndex = parseInt (( Math . random () * 10 / 2 ), 10 ); const randomNumber = numbers [ randomIndex ]; switch ( randomNumber ) { case 1 : console . log ( `The value at randomIndex ${ randomIndex } is 1: ${ randomNumber } ` ); break ; case 2 : console . log ( `The value at randomIndex ${ randomIndex } is 2: ${ randomNumber } ` ); break ; case 3 : console . log ( `The value at randomIndex ${ randomIndex } is 3: ${ randomNumber } ` ); break ; default : // Statements executed when none of the cases match the switch expression console . log ( `The value at randomIndex ${ randomIndex } is 4 or more: ${ randomNumber } ` ) break ; } Ternary (another alternative to if/else) Ternary Operators ? / : can be used as a shorthand for if / else statements: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 const randomNumber = parseInt ( Math . random () * 10 , 10 ); const isEvenOrOdd = ( number ) => { return number % 2 === 0 ? `even: ${ number } ` : `odd: ${ number } ` } isEvenOrOdd ( randomNumber ) They look a little strange at first, but it helps to think of the entire expression as an oddly-punctuated question-and-answer: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // is the remainder of 'evenOrOdd' \u00f7 2 equal to Zero ? <--- `if` return number % 2 === 0 // if so, return 'even:' along with the value : <--- `then return` ? `even: ${ number } ` // otherwise, return 'odd:' along with the value. <--- `else return` : `odd: ${ number } ` Note that the placement of the operators ? / : at the beginning or end of the line doesn't affect the validity of the expression\u2014either way, it will be executed. For that matter, you can write it all on the same line. However, for the sake of readability, it is recommended that you break the operations onto separate lines, with the operators at the beginning of each separate line : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 const randomNumber = parseInt ( Math . random () * 10 , 10 ); const isEvenOrOdd = ( number ) => { return number % 2 === 0 ? `even: ${ number } ` : `odd: ${ number } ` } isEvenOrOdd ( randomNumber ) Formatted like so, it is easy to quickly scan your eyes along the left side of the code and see a ternary expression . This might sound frivolous and nitpicky, but bear in mind that one stylistic downside of using ternary expressions is readability (or lack thereof). They might be more elegant than if / else statements, but they're not always as recognizable at a glance. So use discretion when using them. Practice It - Conditionals For each of the following, create a new Repl.it called the title you see in bold and also name the function the same as the title. Then copy/paste the prompt at the top with the \"//\" so you'll have the challenge right there for you to reference. //sumOfTwoNums - write a function that returns the sum of two numbers if both arguments are numbers. //bothTrue - write a function that returns 'both are true' if both arguments are true. //checkStrings - write a function that takes 3 parameters and if all 3 parameters are strings, return true //evaluateMonth - write a switch statement that evaluates a variable month, and for each of the 12 months, returns the number of days in that month. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // starter code const evaluateMonth = ( month ) => { switch ( month ) { case 'day' : case 'Jan' : { return 31 } default : return '45' } } Know Your Docs MDN Docs - Conditional Statements","title":"Conditionals"},{"location":"module-1/conditionals/#conditional-statements","text":"Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance.\u2003\u2014Eckhart Tolle","title":"Conditional Statements"},{"location":"module-1/conditionals/#function-signatures-review","text":"","title":"Function Signatures Review"},{"location":"module-1/conditionals/#intro-to-conditionals","text":"","title":"Intro to Conditionals"},{"location":"module-1/conditionals/#why-conditionals","text":"Just like we saw in our pre-work, we can compare data and return the results.

It is for this reason that you should learn every array method there is and get good at looping through arrays. Many developer problems are solved this way! The Loops of JavaScript Loops are a way to repeat, or iterate , over a JavaScript thing and perform a certain block of code over and over until the stop condition is met. We can think of this as giving directions for someone to navigate to our house: From I-35 North, exit Berger Rd, Turn right, Drive 5.2 miles and look right for the red fence. The Drive for 5.2 miles is the action statement of the loop. It says, continue driving until the stop condition : 5.2 miles, is met . Obviously this is only a metaphor and we'll have to visualize how loops work in coding, so let's get to that. The common loops we use as web developers are, listed from most often used to least often used: for - loops through a block of code a specific number of times for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object like an array. for/in - loops through the properties of an object or indexes of an array. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true When deciding what loop to use, ask yourself: What is the stop condition (what makes the loop end)? BEWARE the INFINITE LOOP An Infinite Loop is a loop without a stop condition!! This should be avoided at all costs. But this is something you'll just have to learn on your own. This will crash the browser or the JavaScript program that you are in. For Loops For loops are most commonly used to iterate over arrays and strings. The stop condition is usually the length of the array. A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. 1 2 3 4 // this is pseudo-code just to help you visualize & learn the syntax of the for loop for ([ initial expression ]; [ stop condition ]; [ increment expression ]){ action statement } In the example below, we use a for loop to print out numbers from 1 - 10. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 // let's put the for loop inside a function so we can call it when we want instead of just when the program is run. const countUpToTen = () => { for ( let i = 1 ; i <= 10 ; i ++ ) { console . log ( i ); } } countUpToTen () // Your turn! // * Create a for loop that prints out every multiple of 3 up to 100. Paste the code above into a Repl.it and try it yourself. Let's focus on the first line: for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) . for() looks just like a function invocation. And it is. We pass into it the following argument: let i = 1; is the initial expression . It states that the iterator, i, will start at 1. i <= 10; is the stop condition . It states that the loop will stop when the iterator reaches 10 or more. i++ is the increment expression . It increases the iterator by 1 each time the loop runs through. NOTE: We could also decrease by one with i--, increase or decrease by two: i+=2, i-=2, or whatever the problem might need. In the second line: { console.log(i); } { } is the action statement . Whatever is inside these curly braces will be performed once every time the loop is run until the stop condition is met. console.log(i) will log to the console the current value of i. These fundaments are the same in all loops but you'll see that the syntax changes just a little with each. The Other For Loops - For/In and For/Of These two loops are similar but there is a very distinct difference between them! The for/in loop returns the keys or indexes of the thing it's iterating over. The for/of loop returns the value at the current index or key of the thing it's iterating over. For/In loop This loop is used to iterate over object-literals which have key-value pairs. In the code snippet below we see that the object, person, is passed into the function loopOverObject . Then we set two variables that we expect to change: let text = \"\"; and let x; . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 const person = { firstName : \"Peter\" , lastName : \"Wisser\" , age : 25 }; const loopOverObject = ( obj ) => { let text = \"\" ; let x ; for ( x in obj ) { text += obj [ x ] + \" \" ; } return text } loopOverObject ( person ) When we invoke the function, the for/in loop will iterate over the person object using the x variable as a placeholder for each of the keys in the object: firstName , lastName , then age . It's like saying, \"for however many keys are in the object, use x to describe each one as we loop over the object.\" Then we see: text += obj[x] + \" \"; which says the variable text now equals whatever it was plus the value of the current key, x, and then add a space, \" \" , just for readability. After the loop is over return the things we added to the text variables. For/Of Loops The for/of loop works the same way as the for/in loop but instead of objects, it's used on arrays. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 const writers = [ \"Dickinson\" , \"Steinbeck\" , \"Huxley\" ] const loopOverArray = ( arr ) => { let text = \"I love to read \" ; let author ; for ( author of arr ) { text += author + \" and... \" ; } return text } loopOverArray ( writers ) This loop and the for loop are the most common loops you'll be using throughout your career and this course. The Do...While Loop While and do/while loops are used to perform a block of code over and over until a certain condition evaluates to true. For front-end development, it is fairly rare that a while or do while loop would be the best option but, for the sake of thoroughness... A do/while loop repeats something until the condition is evaluated as false. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 // again, pseudo-code here so you can see it more clearly. do { action statement } while ( stop condition ); // Check out what's going on below: const celebrateBirthday = () => { let age = 0 ; do { age += 1 ; console . log ( \"Happy Birthday!! Today you are \" + age + \" year old!\" ); } while ( age < 20 ); } celebrateBirthday () Copy/paste the code above into a Repl.it and let's quickly break this down: let age = 0; - create a variable that's expected to change and set it to 0 do { } - create an action statement age += 1; - each time the loop runs add 1 to the age variable console.log(\"blah blah blah\") - you know what this does while (age < 20) - establish a stop condition: when age is equal to or greater than 20 stop doing the action statement and break out of the loop. The While Loop 1 2 3 while ( condition ) { action statement } Explore the example below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 const logGrade = () => { let grade = 0 ; while ( grade < 70 ) { grade += 10 ; console . log ( \"You have a \" + grade + \" in this class and cannot move on to the next class until your grade is higher than a 70.\" ); } } logGrade () Throw this code into a Repl.it and work through it on your own.

These are great for storing small isolated bits of information, but what if we have large amounts of data, many names of users, phone numbers, and emails we want to use to contact our clients? It would be rather hard to maintain all of that if we had to declare a variable for each one, and then we would have to build functions for each one, too! To solve this problem of listing items we have arrays which are just that, lists or collections of items grouped together in one variable. All arrays are objects, but not all objects are arrays. This is a confusing phrase but don't worry, it'll make sense later on. Let's start by learning how to declare an array . You declare an array just like you would a variable but instead of quotes like a string, use brackets like this: [] . Now you can put the items inside the [] (brackets) and separate the items in an array with a comma (see below). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 const exampleArray = [ 'h' , 'e' , 'l' , 'l' , 'o' ] const ourCarTypes = [ \"Saab\" , \"Volvo\" , \"BMW\" ] const itemArray = [ 'item1' , 'item2' ] const arrayOfNumbers = [ 1 , 200 , 98 , 75 , 4 , 4000 ] An array is a collection or list of items . This collection of items could be a collection of anything , like a collections of numbers : const anArrayOfNumbers = [ 3 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 ] Or a collection / list of strings : const anArrayOfStrings = [ \"cat\" , \"mail\" , \"stars\" , \"hero\" ] Or a collection / list of Booleans : const anArrayOfBooleans = [ true , false , true , true , false , true ] Or a collection / list of multiple data types : const anArrayOfMixedTypes = [ true , 12 , \"people\" , false , 6 , 29 , \"happy\" ] It could even be a collection of functions or more arrays within the array : const addTwo = ( num1 , num2 ) => num1 + num2 const anArray = [ 2 , 5 , 7 , 68 , 12 ] const anArrayOfMoreObjects = [ addTwo , anArray ] Really, we can store any JavaScript thing in an array. There are a few useful reasons we would store items in an array, including: Anything can be stored in an array. Each item in an array has an index , meaning we can access the items in the array by the order in which they are listed! You can loop over arrays. That is to say, we can write code that will grab each item in an array and do whatever we tell it to do with each item! Arrays have many, many useful methods already built in to them!!! For all of these reasons, type Array is probably one of the most useable data types in JavaScript!!! Array Indexes Start with 0 Items in an array each have a unique index that represents the order in which they appear. You access items in an array by their index, so order is important. It's also important to remember, just like strings, arrays are 0 indexed. 0 indexed means the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, the third item has an index of 2 and so forth. Basically, counting begins at 0, not 1. 1 2 3 // an array of letters const exampleArray = [ 'h' , 'e' , 'l' , 'l' , 'o' ] console . log ( exampleArray [ 1 ]) Using the example code above: console.log(exampleArray[1]) would log to the console e because arrays are 0 indexed . To access 'h' you would need to use exampleArray[0] . You can re-assign items in the array in a similar manner: exampleArray[1] = \u2018y\u2019 would rewrite the data in the array to look like this: [\u2018h\u2019,\u2019y\u2019,\u2019l\u2019,\u2019l\u2019,\u2019o\u2019] . Again, the items stored in an array can be of any primitive or higher-order data type you've learned about so far: Number, null, String, Array, Object, Function, Boolean, Node, etc. Side-note: When we put arrays inside arrays we call this nesting which creates a fancy thing called a multi-dimensional array . See below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 const multiArrays = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 5 ], [ 90 , 5 , 8 , 65 , 3 ], [ \"dog\" , \"tooth\" , \"friend\" ]] console . log ( multiArrays [ 1 ]) // => [90, 5, 8, 65, 3] console . log ( multiArrays [ 0 ]) // => [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 5] console . log ( multiArrays [ 0 ][ 3 ]) // => 6 console . log ( multiArrays [ 2 ][ 2 ]) // => \"friend\" Notice that multiArrays has three arrays inside of it. When we console.log indexes 0 , 1 , or 2 we get the whole array at that index, but we can go even deeper by tacking two square-brackets on top of each other: [][] and putting numbers in them: [1][4] . This tells the computer to find the array we're seeking, of index [1] , then go inside that array and get the item we're seeking with an index of [4] , from that array. This can go deeper: anArray[2][2][0] , and deeper: anArray[2][2][0][7] , and deeper: anArray[2][2][0][7][2] depending on how many arrays are nested within the original array. Practice Nested Arrays Copy/Paste the following code into a Repl.it 1 2 3 4 5 const numArr = [ [ 4 , 7 , 9 ], [ 10 , 45 , 300 ], [ 88 , 64 , 37 , 93 ] ]; Write a console.log statement that prints out the number 300 from the given array. Write a console.log statement that prints out the number 64 from the given array. Write a console.log statement that prints out the number 4 from the given array. Looping Over an Array The For Loop A for loop repeats an action over and over until a specified condition evaluates to false. What that means is that we tell the for loop what conditions to meet and what actions to do until those conditions are met. First things first: A for loop is a function that takes in arguments like any other function. Those arguments look like this: declare a variable that will hold an iterator: Initial Expression loop until the iterator meets a specific value: Condition how much the iterator should increase or decrease: Increment Expression Look at the syntax below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 for ([ initialExpression ]; [ condition ]; [ incrementExpression ]) { action statement } // or, the same thing with real numbers and variables const myArr = [ 2 , 33 , 4 , 54 , 13 , 8 , 79 ] let sum = 0 for ( let i = 0 ; i <= myArr . length - 1 ; i ++ ) { sum += myArr [ i ] } In the code snippet above, the for loop states: Set an iterator variable, i , at 0. While the iterator, i , is less than or equal to the length of myArr minus 1, continue doing the action statement (We need to subtract 1 because the last index will be one less than the total length. Remember 0 indexed?) . After each loop, add 1 to the value of i . Inside the Action Statement , we add to the variable sum the value of sum + the value at the current index of the loop, which is held in the iterator, i . Try it yourself, Copy/paste the following code into a Repl.it and run it! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 const myArr = [ 2 , 33 , 4 , 54 , 13 , 8 , 79 ] const myFunFunction = ( arr ) => { let sum = 0 for ( let i = 0 ; i <= arr . length - 1 ; i ++ ) { console . log ( \"The value of 'i' is: \" + i + \" and the value at that index is: \" + arr [ i ]) sum += arr [ i ] } return console . log ( \"The final sum is: \" + sum ) } myFunFunction ( myArr ) Create a for loop to print out numbers from 1 - 10. Create a for loop to print out every multiple of 3 up to 100. The Methods of Array Types By now, we've talked about methods as baked-in functions that JavaScript things come with so we can manipulate those things easily. You don't have to do anything special to get them to work\u2014all you have to do is learn about them and then call them by name when you want to use them. As you learn more about the language you'll come to learn and appreciate all of the wonderful methods JavaScript has to offer, specifically for arrays, since they come with some of the most powerful methods in the JavaScript environment! As an example, .length is a simple and yet very powerful method used all the time! You saw this method used above. When you call .length on an array, it will return the number of items in the array. 1 const multiArrays = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 5 ], [ 90 , 5 , 8 , 65 , 3 ], [ \"dog\" , \"tooth\" , \"friend\" ]] Example: If we console.log(multiArrays.length) from the example above we would get 3 because that array has three items in it. If we console.log(multiArrays[0].length) we would get 6 . Note: The index of the last item in an array is always equal to the .length of the array minus one ( console.log(multiArrays[1].length - 1) // => 4 ). You can use this method to get the value of the last item too! c onsole.log(multiArrays[1][multiArrays[1].length - 1]) => 3 Start looking at these array methods and see if you can play with some dummy variables with them. Simply copy/paste some of the code snippets above into a Repl.it , add more data to them and try some of these methods inside a console.log statement. See what you come up with. The Most Important Methods For Pig Latin you will need the first 8 array methods listed below. Open a new Repl.it, create some dummy arrays and begin playing with these methods just the same way you've played with strings, numbers, and Booleans. .slice() .splice() .toString() .concat() .includes() .pop() .push() .join() .length .indexOf() .shift() .unshift() .every() .flat() .find() .reverse() .forEach() Hint: For Pig Latin you'll also need the string method: .split() each method now and make flashcards to memorize them and make your programming faster! No Two Arrays Are Equal BIG NOTE: One important thing to remember about arrays: no two arrays are the same array. So, even if you declared two arrays and gave them the same values, they will not be equal. See below: 1 2 3 4 const arr1 = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] const arr2 = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] arr1 === arr2 // => false Questions: How would you find out if two arrays contain the same values? Think about it and see if you can come up with an answer before class. Mutability Before moving forward we should learn about a word called mutability . Derived from the word \"mutate\", to change; as in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . In programming terms, this simply means that the original data we are working with can be changed or is permanently changed. Permanently changing the original data/data structure is something that should generally be avoided. This is where the word immutable comes into play. We bring up immutability here because some of the array methods you just learned about permanently change the data in the array while others return a new array without mutating the original data. While you're discovering the methods, make sure to ask these four questions of each method: What does the method do? What does the method return? What arguments does the method take? Does the method change the original data? You'll learn when to change data and when not to as you go deeper , but for now just become aware of what each methods does, what it returns, and if it's changing the original array. An example of a method that mutates the original array is . push() : exampleArray.push(\u2018x\u2019) . This method would add the string 'x' to the end of exampleArray and thereby permanently change the array. The push method also returns the new length of the string. So if exampleArray had 5 elements, and you declared const newLength = exampleArray.push('x') , newLength would be equal to 6, and the string 'x' would be added to the end of exampleArray . Adding new items to an array can also be accomplished without mutation by using the concat method, which merges two arrays, or merges values into an array: const exArr2 = exampleArray.concat('x') . In this case, exampleArray would not be changed, and exArr2 would be the same as exArr , but with the string 'x' added to the end of the array. This is an example of a non-mutating array method. To learn more about mutating and non-mutating array methods you can check out this blog post , but keep in mind that unlike in this article, in most cases you will want to declare all of your arrays with const , not let , whether or not you intend to mutate them.

These are great for storing small isolated bits of information, but what if we have large amounts of data, many names of users, phone numbers, and emails we want to use to contact our clients? It would be rather hard to maintain all of that if we had to declare a variable for each one, and then we would have to build functions for each one, too! To solve this problem of listing items we have arrays which are just that, lists or collections of items grouped together in one variable. All arrays are objects, but not all objects are arrays. This is a confusing phrase but don't worry, it'll make sense later on. Let's start by learning how to declare an array . You declare an array just like you would a variable but instead of quotes like a string, use brackets like this: [] . Now you can put the items inside the [] (brackets) and separate the items in an array with a comma (see below). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 const exampleArray = [ 'h' , 'e' , 'l' , 'l' , 'o' ] const ourCarTypes = [ \"Saab\" , \"Volvo\" , \"BMW\" ] const itemArray = [ 'item1' , 'item2' ] const arrayOfNumbers = [ 1 , 200 , 98 , 75 , 4 , 4000 ] An array is a collection or list of items . This collection of items could be a collection of anything , like a collections of numbers : const anArrayOfNumbers = [ 3 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 ] Or a collection / list of strings : const anArrayOfStrings = [ \"cat\" , \"mail\" , \"stars\" , \"hero\" ] Or a collection / list of Booleans : const anArrayOfBooleans = [ true , false , true , true , false , true ] Or a collection / list of multiple data types : const anArrayOfMixedTypes = [ true , 12 , \"people\" , false , 6 , 29 , \"happy\" ] It could even be a collection of functions or more arrays within the array : const addTwo = ( num1 , num2 ) => num1 + num2 const anArray = [ 2 , 5 , 7 , 68 , 12 ] const anArrayOfMoreObjects = [ addTwo , anArray ] Really, we can store any JavaScript thing in an array. There are a few useful reasons we would store items in an array, including: Anything can be stored in an array. Each item in an array has an index , meaning we can access the items in the array by the order in which they are listed! You can loop over arrays. That is to say, we can write code that will grab each item in an array and do whatever we tell it to do with each item! Arrays have many, many useful methods already built in to them!!! For all of these reasons, type Array is probably one of the most useable data types in JavaScript!!!","title":"Overview"},{"location":"module-1/typeArray/#array-indexes-start-with-0","text":"Items in an array each have a unique index that represents the order in which they appear. You access items in an array by their index, so order is important. It's also important to remember, just like strings, arrays are 0 indexed. 0 indexed means the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, the third item has an index of 2 and so forth. Basically, counting begins at 0, not 1. 1 2 3 // an array of letters const exampleArray = [ 'h' , 'e' , 'l' , 'l' , 'o' ] console . log ( exampleArray [ 1 ]) Using the example code above: console.log(exampleArray[1]) would log to the console e because arrays are 0 indexed . To access 'h' you would need to use exampleArray[0] . You can re-assign items in the array in a similar manner: exampleArray[1] = \u2018y\u2019 would rewrite the data in the array to look like this: [\u2018h\u2019,\u2019y\u2019,\u2019l\u2019,\u2019l\u2019,\u2019o\u2019] . Again, the items stored in an array can be of any primitive or higher-order data type you've learned about so far: Number, null, String, Array, Object, Function, Boolean, Node, etc. Side-note: When we put arrays inside arrays we call this nesting which creates a fancy thing called a multi-dimensional array . See below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 const multiArrays = [[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 5 ], [ 90 , 5 , 8 , 65 , 3 ], [ \"dog\" , \"tooth\" , \"friend\" ]] console . log ( multiArrays [ 1 ]) // => [90, 5, 8, 65, 3] console . log ( multiArrays [ 0 ]) // => [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 5] console . log ( multiArrays [ 0 ][ 3 ]) // => 6 console . log ( multiArrays [ 2 ][ 2 ]) // => \"friend\" Notice that multiArrays has three arrays inside of it. When we console.log indexes 0 , 1 , or 2 we get the whole array at that index, but we can go even deeper by tacking two square-brackets on top of each other: [][] and putting numbers in them: [1][4] . This tells the computer to find the array we're seeking, of index [1] , then go inside that array and get the item we're seeking with an index of [4] , from that array. This can go deeper: anArray[2][2][0] , and deeper: anArray[2][2][0][7] , and deeper: anArray[2][2][0][7][2] depending on how many arrays are nested within the original array.","title":"Array Indexes Start with 0"},{"location":"module-1/typeArray/#practice-nested-arrays","text":"Copy/Paste the following code into a Repl.it 1 2 3 4 5 const numArr = [ [ 4 , 7 , 9 ], [ 10 , 45 , 300 ], [ 88 , 64 , 37 , 93 ] ]; Write a console.log statement that prints out the number 300 from the given array.

You\u2019re all you\u2019ve got.\u2003\u2014Janis Joplin Overview So far we've been working with primitive data types, like data type: Number, String, and Boolean. These are great for storing small isolated bits of information, but what happens when you want to store related information such as the make, model, color, VIN, drive-train, passenger capacity, fuel type, and CarFax history of every the car in a dealership's parking lot of cars? Or if you want to store the names of all of a user's friends on a social media platform? By using the data type: Object-Literal we can group related pieces of data together in a way that makes our database easier to access and manipulate. The name \"Object-Literal\" is used because all things are objects as you learned in 101 but because this type is syntactically written out the way all objects are under-the-hood we call them \"Object-Literals\" as in Literally an Object . The first wonderful aspect of objects is that they store data by unique keys . Instead of indexes like arrays, objects have keys that reference each of the various values stored in the object. The keys and values together are called key-value pairs. The simple rule about creating an object's keys is that they must be strings, usually words, or even symbols while the values can be any data type including Array, Object, Function, Boolean, Number, String, or Byte. Unlike arrays, when we access values in an object, order does not matter. Let's take this code snippet for example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 const exampleObject = { name : \"Pete\" , age : 58 , weight : \"150 lbs\" , id : 6089 , pets : [ { species : 'canine' , name : 'Fido' }, { species : 'feline' , name : 'Pandora' } ], employment : { company : 'GE' , role : 'engineer' , salary : 98000 } }; console . log ( exampleObject . id ) // => 6089 console . log ( exampleObject . weight ) // \"150 lbs\" To get the value of the id key of this object we use dot-notation , exampleObject.id . It would not matter if id was the first key or the three thousandth key, all we would need to access that information/data is the object's variable name, exampleObject , and the key name, id . Creating and Object-Literal You create an object the same way you declare any other data type: First declare const Then name the object, person Point it at the object-literal, = But instead of square-brackets, use curly-braces , {} After that separate the keys and values by colons, : Finally, separate key-value pairs by commas, , Check it out below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 const person = { firstName : \"Keith\" , lastName : \"Murgic\" , age : 31 , eyeColor : \"brown\" }; person is the name of the object, firstName , lastName , and eyeColor are properties or keys of person , and the corresponding property values are \"Keith\" , \"Murgic\" , 31 , and \"brown\" . Accessing Object-Literals You can access information stored in objects in two ways: 1 2 3 4 5 // Dot-Notation: objectName.propertyName console . log ( person . firstName ) // => \"Keith\" // Bracket-Notation: objectName[\"propertyName\"] console . log ( person [ \"firstName\" ]) // => \"Keith\" Just like accessing built-in methods, we can use dot-notation : .firstName . It's important to know that dot notation can only be used when you know the property's key name. This may seem obvious but when we move on to calling the values by some conditional if statement we won't know which will be called at any given time, so we have to wrap the value in quotation marks, \"firstName\" , and pass that into the square brackets, [\"firstName\"] . Writing Data into Objects-Literals Before pushing forward, it's important to discuss the difference between read and write , as they relate to computers. Read means we're accessing data and displaying it somewhere without changing it. Write means we're changing the data either from scratch or editing it. Therefore to write , or change, or add a new key:value pair in an object, simply access the value and set it equal to the new value as you would do when you declare a new variable or re-point a variable to a new value. See below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 const person = { firstName : \"Keith\" , lastName : \"Murgic\" , age : 31 , eyeColor : \"brown\" }; // Before we change the value console . log ( person . age ) // => 31 // Use either a dot or brackets person . age = 50 person [ \"age\" ] = 50 // Now a new value will be returned console . log ( person . age ) // => 50 // Add a key:value person . birthDate = \"1/16/1860\" console . log ( person ) // => { firstName: \"Keith\", lastName: \"Murgic\", age: 50, eyeColor: \"brown\", birthDate: \"1/16/1860\" } // also see Object.assign() When building your objects remember, each key must be unique. There can never be two keys that are the same. However, values can be repeated as many times as needed. The following object would not be a properly formatted object because there are two id keys: 1 2 3 4 const anObject = { id : 5 , name : \u2018 Renee \u2019 , id : 7 } // This, however, is a properly formatted object: const anObject = { id : 5 , name : \u2018 Renee \u2019 , label : 7 } You might be asking why these objects are on one line but the others we've looked at are on multiple lines. This is only for legibility. Whitespace makes code easier to read by the human eye. Accessing Nested Data In real world data, you will see objects with arrays as values and arrays with objects as values, so it\u2019s critical that you can access nested data, or objects within arrays, arrays within objects, arrays within arrays and so forth! Getting good at this is worth the time spent NOW!! Let's take a look at the object below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 const user = { accessCodes : [ 49303 , 493020 , 904040 , 900404 ], env : [ \"PA\" , \"NY\" , \"CT\" , \"VT\" ], filter : { id : 580 , branch : \"origin\" } } console . log ( user . accessCodes ) // => [49303, 493020, 904040, 900404] console . log ( user . accessCodes [ 1 ]) // => 493020 Remember to access data one step at a time. In order to access the second item in the accessCodes array, first you need to access the accessCode property then use the return of that first step (which is an array) to access the second item in the array. This can be accomplished in two ways, bracket or dot notation: user[\u2018accessCodes\u2019][1] or user.accessCodes[1] . Both ways return: 493020 . On your own, think about how you would access the age property of the second element, Zuke , in the friends array below. Copy/paste the object into a Repl.it and experiment. 1 2 3 4 const user = { name : 'Keith' , friends : [{ name : 'Meghan' , age : '27' }, { name : 'Zuke' , age : '3' }] } The Methods of Object-Literals The reason you've been able to access all of these built-in methods of strings, arrays, numbers, or Booleans is because they're all created through a prototype , which is an object in JavaScript that says: \"Hey, when a JavaScript thing is created, use this template, or prototype , to make it so that all JavaScript things operate the same way.\" Because of this, all strings have the same methods, and arrays have the same methods as other arrays. We don't need to go into depth with the prototype thing right now but it's important for you to understand that it is an object just like the ones you're studying right now. Just like an HTML element in the Document Object Model (DOM) and just like a CSS rule with its {} . With all of that, take a look at this code snippet: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 const person = { firstName : \"Keith\" , lastName : \"Murgic\" , age : 31 , eyeColor : \"brown\" , talk : function ( friend ) { console . log ( \"Hello, \" + friend ) } }; console . log ( person . talk ( \"Peter\" )) We see there is a function called talk set as a property on this object. Using dot notation we can access this function: person.talk(\"Peter\") . 1 person . talk ( \"Peter\" ) // => 'Hello, Peter' Any time a function is put on an object like this, it's called a method . :) Sound familiar? Yes, all of those methods you've used for strings, arrays, and numbers are all functions built on the prototype object/template of those data types just like this .talk() method is built on person. Again, don't worry about understanding the prototype, it's not important right now. But, speaking of methods, objects come with their own built-in methods and you should look at them for yourself before class! Commonly Used Methods of the Object-Literal The first method we'll cover is .create() because it helps introduce OOP , object-oriented programming , in a small and helpful way. You see, when we create an app with multiple users, each of our users will have similar data structures like: name , id , password , email , phone , address , and username . Each of these pieces of data will become our keys which create a template for all new users of our app to follow. This template structure is the basis of object-oriented programming where we only have to build the template once so we can reuse it over and over again as our app and database grow: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 // Create a template object that holds the keys we'll need for each of our users const ourUserTemplate = { name : \"\" , id : Number , password : \"\" , email : \"\" , phone : \"\" , address : \"\" , username : \"\" , location : \"\" , printNameOnHomeScreen : function () { return `Hello, ${ this . name } . It looks like you're in ${ this . location } .` ; } } // Create a new user with the Object.create() method and the template object passed into it const constantineAlfonso = Object . create ( ourUserTemplate ) // Add a value to the name key of the new object & a value to the location key constantineAlfonso . name = \"Constantine Alfonso\" constantineAlfonso . location = \"Dallas, TX\" // Log out the value console . log ( constantineAlfonso . printNameOnHomeScreen ()) Copy/paste the code above in to your own Repl.it and see what's happening for yourself. Notice the way we use the .create() method. Instead of calling it directly on the template object, we call it on the Object prototype and pass in the template we'd like it to use. Then we can change values afterwards. Google each of these and use the code sample above with each one in a Repl.it to see what you can find out on your own. .entries() .assign() .keys() .is() Of course, you should push to learn a new one everyday but these will be good ones to start with.

These are great for storing small isolated bits of information, but what happens when you want to store related information such as the make, model, color, VIN, drive-train, passenger capacity, fuel type, and CarFax history of every the car in a dealership's parking lot of cars? Or if you want to store the names of all of a user's friends on a social media platform? By using the data type: Object-Literal we can group related pieces of data together in a way that makes our database easier to access and manipulate. The name \"Object-Literal\" is used because all things are objects as you learned in 101 but because this type is syntactically written out the way all objects are under-the-hood we call them \"Object-Literals\" as in Literally an Object . The first wonderful aspect of objects is that they store data by unique keys . Instead of indexes like arrays, objects have keys that reference each of the various values stored in the object. The keys and values together are called key-value pairs. The simple rule about creating an object's keys is that they must be strings, usually words, or even symbols while the values can be any data type including Array, Object, Function, Boolean, Number, String, or Byte. Unlike arrays, when we access values in an object, order does not matter. Let's take this code snippet for example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 const exampleObject = { name : \"Pete\" , age : 58 , weight : \"150 lbs\" , id : 6089 , pets : [ { species : 'canine' , name : 'Fido' }, { species : 'feline' , name : 'Pandora' } ], employment : { company : 'GE' , role : 'engineer' , salary : 98000 } }; console . log ( exampleObject . id ) // => 6089 console . log ( exampleObject . weight ) // \"150 lbs\" To get the value of the id key of this object we use dot-notation , exampleObject.id . It would not matter if id was the first key or the three thousandth key, all we would need to access that information/data is the object's variable name, exampleObject , and the key name, id .","title":"Overview"},{"location":"module-1/typeObjectLiteral/#creating-and-object-literal","text":"You create an object the same way you declare any other data type: First declare const Then name the object, person Point it at the object-literal, = But instead of square-brackets, use curly-braces , {} After that separate the keys and values by colons, : Finally, separate key-value pairs by commas, , Check it out below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 const person = { firstName : \"Keith\" , lastName : \"Murgic\" , age : 31 , eyeColor : \"brown\" }; person is the name of the object, firstName , lastName , and eyeColor are properties or keys of person , and the corresponding property values are \"Keith\" , \"Murgic\" , 31 , and \"brown\" .","title":"Creating and Object-Literal"},{"location":"module-1/typeObjectLiteral/#accessing-object-literals","text":"You can access information stored in objects in two ways: 1 2 3 4 5 // Dot-Notation: objectName.propertyName console . log ( person . firstName ) // => \"Keith\" // Bracket-Notation: objectName[\"propertyName\"] console . log ( person [ \"firstName\" ]) // => \"Keith\" Just like accessing built-in methods, we can use dot-notation : .firstName . It's important to know that dot notation can only be used when you know the property's key name. This may seem obvious but when we move on to calling the values by some conditional if statement we won't know which will be called at any given time, so we have to wrap the value in quotation marks, \"firstName\" , and pass that into the square brackets, [\"firstName\"] .","title":"Accessing Object-Literals"},{"location":"module-1/typeObjectLiteral/#writing-data-into-objects-literals","text":"Before pushing forward, it's important to discuss the difference between read and write , as they relate to computers. Read means we're accessing data and displaying it somewhere without changing it. Write means we're changing the data either from scratch or editing it. Therefore to write , or change, or add a new key:value pair in an object, simply access the value and set it equal to the new value as you would do when you declare a new variable or re-point a variable to a new value. See below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 const person = { firstName : \"Keith\" , lastName : \"Murgic\" , age : 31 , eyeColor : \"brown\" }; // Before we change the value console . log ( person . age ) // => 31 // Use either a dot or brackets person . age = 50 person [ \"age\" ] = 50 // Now a new value will be returned console . log ( person . age ) // => 50 // Add a key:value person . birthDate = \"1/16/1860\" console . log ( person ) // => { firstName: \"Keith\", lastName: \"Murgic\", age: 50, eyeColor: \"brown\", birthDate: \"1/16/1860\" } // also see Object.assign() When building your objects remember, each key must be unique. There can never be two keys that are the same. However, values can be repeated as many times as needed. The following object would not be a properly formatted object because there are two id keys: 1 2 3 4 const anObject = { id : 5 , name : \u2018 Renee \u2019 , id : 7 } // This, however, is a properly formatted object: const anObject = { id : 5 , name : \u2018 Renee \u2019 , label : 7 } You might be asking why these objects are on one line but the others we've looked at are on multiple lines.

Let's take a look at the object below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 const user = { accessCodes : [ 49303 , 493020 , 904040 , 900404 ], env : [ \"PA\" , \"NY\" , \"CT\" , \"VT\" ], filter : { id : 580 , branch : \"origin\" } } console . log ( user . accessCodes ) // => [49303, 493020, 904040, 900404] console . log ( user . accessCodes [ 1 ]) // => 493020 Remember to access data one step at a time. In order to access the second item in the accessCodes array, first you need to access the accessCode property then use the return of that first step (which is an array) to access the second item in the array. This can be accomplished in two ways, bracket or dot notation: user[\u2018accessCodes\u2019][1] or user.accessCodes[1] . Both ways return: 493020 . On your own, think about how you would access the age property of the second element, Zuke , in the friends array below.

We don't need to go into depth with the prototype thing right now but it's important for you to understand that it is an object just like the ones you're studying right now. Just like an HTML element in the Document Object Model (DOM) and just like a CSS rule with its {} .

Using dot notation we can access this function: person.talk(\"Peter\") . 1 person . talk ( \"Peter\" ) // => 'Hello, Peter' Any time a function is put on an object like this, it's called a method . :) Sound familiar? Yes, all of those methods you've used for strings, arrays, and numbers are all functions built on the prototype object/template of those data types just like this .talk() method is built on person.

To begin, you'll always know a string by the single-quotes or double-quotes wrapped around the characters. Notice I said characters and not numbers. That's because \"1976\" is a string, and so is \"I have a dog.\" as well as \"My address is 89 Parmer Way.\" Literally, any set of characters between quotes is a string. We use strings to store data when we don't need to do calculations on them like we would with numbers, when we don't need to iterate through multiple pieces of data, and when what we're storing is relatively simple like text and even phone numbers: \"214-990-0009\" . Dot-Notation Before we can learn the built-in methods of String we should cover that little . you've seen before in the Number and Math methods, called the Member Operator . Below you'll see a few of the built-in methods you can use on strings. To access them you'll notice a . between the variable that holds the string value and the method that's called. This Dot Notation is very common and you've actually already seen it before, but let's spend just a bit of time understanding why we need to use it. With objects like functions and standard JavaScript objects we can access the properties on them with a .. Look at the JavaScript object below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 const myObject = { id : 1693 , name : \"John Proctor\" } console . log ( myObject . id ) // => 1693 console . log ( myObject . name ) // => John Proctor Although there is a little bit more syntax in this example than you've seen so far, you can see the properties on the object: id and name . We can access each of these with a ., i.e. myObject.id = 1693. We can do the same thing with our String data types because they each reference the same object in the JavaScript library: the prototype. As we create a new variable and assign it a string variable, our computer will point the variable to the prototype object so that we have access to the built-in methods of the String data type. Therefore, we can simply type myString.length and get the length of the string instead of prototype.myString.length . DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE PROTOTYPE RIGHT NOW, we'll talk about it in depth later on. You can use dot notation on any object as long as you know the key or attribute of the thing you're trying to reference. But let's get back to strings! A Short List of Common String Methods Remember, you will have to reference the documentation on each data type regularly to learn and remember each of their methods, but here we'll talk about some of the most common ones which should include the one's you'll need to complete the Pig Latin app. .length returns the number of characters in a string including spaces. NOTE: length doesn't require parenthesis. Why? .indexOf() method returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of a specified text in a string. .lastIndexOf() method returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified text in a string. .search() method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match. .concat() ...(see docs) .substring() ...(see docs) .replace() ...(see docs) .charAt() ...(see docs) .trim() ...(see docs) .split() changes a string to an array - Useful for PigLatin .slice() takes in two parameters to extract and return a part of a string. In the following example we see the .slice() method used on a string. * .slice() takes the characters between the two indexes you provide in the arguments. In this example we invoke .slice(6, 10) . 1 2 3 4 const exampleString = \"Apples are delicious!\" ; const exampleSlice = exampleString . slice ( 6 , 10 ); console . log ( exampleSlice ) // => \"are\" When we count the positions in strings, we must remember that they are 0 indexed . This means that the first position of a string is 0, the second position is 1, the third position is 2 and so forth. Because of this, the indexes in the example above are: exampleString[0] = \"A\" , exampleString[1] = \"p\" , exampleString[4] = \"e\" , exampleString[6] = \" \" , exampleString[9] = \"e\" , exampleString[11] = \"d\" So slice(7,13) will return the characters from the indexes between 7 and 13. Pop that code into a Repl.it and play to make sure you understand 0 indexed . Bracket-Notation We just did something back there with the [] that helped us access the values of the string. Let's take a look at that. With lists of items like a string or arrays we can access any position we want using bracket notation , [] , because each of the positions are indexed . So if we want to get the \"!\" in the \"Apples are delicious!\" string example, we would write: exampleString[20] which will return \"!\" . Try it yourself if you don't believe me. Because the positions are indexed, we can also loop over each position with a for loop just like we would with an Array, as you'll do in Pig Latin: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // create an example string to play with const myString = \"Love\" // create a function that will loop over ANY string given to it const anExampleForLoop = ( str ) => { for ( let i = 0 ; i < str . length ; i ++ ) { console . log ( str [ i ]) } } // pass the string into the function anExampleForLoop ( myString ) In the example above, we created a for loop that: sets i to be 0 so we can access the first position of the string then continues to move forward as long as i is less than the length of myString or, in the scope of the function: str each time it loops, the value of i is increased by 1: i++ during each loop it logs to the console the character in the current position of str[i] The expected return of this code snippet should be: 1 2 3 4 L O V E Try it Yourself!! Throw it into a REPL.IT ! The great thing about bracket notation is that you can use variables inside the [] just like the i you see above. In that example, i is a variable. We don't know the value of it at any given point but we assume it will be 0, then 1, then 2, then 3. Simple rule to live by: If you need to use a variable or a number to access a position of something, you will need to use [] and not ..

Take a look at the JSON object in this example link and see if you know how to access each object, its product_name and unit_cost . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 [{ \"_id\" : { \"$oid\" : \"5968dd23fc13ae04d9000001\" }, \"product_name\" : \"sildenafil citrate\" , \"supplier\" : \"Wisozk Inc\" , \"quantity\" : 261 , \"unit_cost\" : \"$10.47\" }, { \"_id\" : { \"$oid\" : \"5968dd23fc13ae04d9000002\" }, \"product_name\" : \"Mountain Juniperus ashei\" , \"supplier\" : \"Keebler-Hilpert\" , \"quantity\" : 292 , \"unit_cost\" : \"$8.74\" }, { \"_id\" : { \"$oid\" : \"5968dd23fc13ae04d9000003\" }, \"product_name\" : \"Dextromathorphan HBr\" , \"supplier\" : \"Schmitt-Weissnat\" , \"quantity\" : 211 , \"unit_cost\" : \"$20.53\" }] Try it. Store it in a variable in a repl.it and see if you can log the values to the console. Accessing Large Objects When accessing complex data structures, keep in mind the structure that you are accessing and what the return will be. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 const userObj = { likes : [ { id : 1 , name : 'basketball' }, { id : 2 , name : 'football' }, { id : 3 , name : 'cooking' }, ], firstName : 'Tom' , lastName : 'Riddle' , posts : { 1 / 4 / 2018 : 'today I ate pizza' , 2 / 14 / 2018 : 'happy valentines day' , 2 / 15 / 2018 : 'its 5 o\u2019clock somewhere' } } For example, if you received the user object above from the database, and you wanted to display the user's most recent like: First you would determine what type of data structure userObj is. In this case, it\u2019s an object. To access a value, I would need the key name. For this problem, it\u2019s likes . So the first step is: userObj[\"likes\"][0] , which would return {id: 1, name: 'basketball'} The second step returns an object, which still isn\u2019t a very consumable piece of information for the user, ideally we would just show a string. So to access the name value in this object, an additional locator is needed for the name key: userObj['likes'][0]['name'] , which would return 'basketball' Sometimes, you need to display all of the information in an object by looping over every key. However, objects do not have access to the concise and convenient loops that arrays have access to. The method Object.keys() will return an array of object keys. Then you can use that returned array to loop through each of the object keys. And since the values in an object can be accessed by the key names, each time you loop through a key name, you can also access the value. For example, if I wanted to show the end user all of the posts from the userObj , first I would access the post object. userObj[\u2018posts\u2019] would return an object: 1 2 3 4 5 { 1 / 4 / 2018 : 'today I ate pizza' , 2 / 14 / 2018 : 'happy valentines day' , 2 / 15 / 2018 : 'its 5 o\u2019clock somewhere' } Object.keys(userObj[\"posts\"]) returns an array of the keys [ \"1/4/2018\",\"2/14/2018\", \"2/15/2018\"] Remember, objects are made of key-value pairs! If we use the .keys() object prototype method we will get the keys of all the key-value pairs in the objects. If we use the object prototype method .entries() , we'll get the values of all the key-value pairs in the object. A forEach loop is the best option to use here. It has decreased scope, simplified syntax, and doesn\u2019t have the possibility of an infinite loop. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Object . keys ( userObj [ \u2018 posts \u2019 ]). forEach (( key ) => { console . log ( key ) }); // I am using key as the variable name because I want to be as descriptive as possible. // This would print out in the console: // 1/4/2018 // 2/14/2018 // 2/15/2018 Because I have both the key and the object, I can also gain access to the value associated: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Object . keys ( userObj [ \"posts\" ]). forEach (( key ) => { console . log ( `The key is ${ key } , and the post is: ${ userObj [ \"posts\" ][ key ] } ` ) }) // This would print out in the console => // The key is 1/4/2018, and the post is: today I ate pizza // The key is 2/14/2018, and the post is: happy valentines day // The key is 2/15/2018, and the post is: its 5 o\u2019clock somewhere Before you finish up here, make sure to watch the videos in the Additional Resources .bind() & this from MDN, The .bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. from MDN, this : ES5 introduced the bind() method to set the value of a function's this regardless of how it's called, and ES2015 introduced arrow functions which don't provide their own this binding (they retain the this value of the enclosing lexical context ). this and .bind() are complex ideas. However they are concepts we must accept, understand and use if we want to grow in our programming abilities with JavaScript as our scripting language. Today we'll simply scratch the surface of these two topics in preparation of our next two weeks' subjects: OOP (object-oriented programming) and higher order functions. We will definitely come back to these two concepts again. For a short summary, think of this as referring to this instance of where the function is called. Inside the object it refers to this instance. Think of .bind() as forcing or binding a variable to a specific function regardless of instance.

Create a Repl.it and turn in the URL of it. Pt. 3 - MasterMind [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game%29) is a code-breaking game, where a player tries to guess the code based on a limited amount of information given from an incorrect guess. You can play the game here . MasterMind App Specs Create a new branch called \"masterMind\" Spec 0 - Define a test solution : Helpful suggestion: while developing you can set a default solution for you to test against. At the top of mastermind() , simply set const solution = 'abcd'; as a global variable. Spec 1 - Detect a correct solution : In mastermind() , if the guess you passed in equals the solution , return 'You guessed it!'; Spec 2 - Generate a hint: generateHint() should take one argument, guess. Spec 2.1 - Split up the solution and guess : In generateHint() , create variables solutionArray and guessArray that each split up passed in arguments, [.split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/splitting on '' (empty string). Spec 2.2 - Determine correct \"letter-locations\" : Create a variable correctLetterLocations and set it to 0 . This variable will record how many correct \"letter-locations\" were guessed. For instance, a guess of aabc against a solution of deba would yield one correct \"letter-location\" (b). In a for loop, iterate over the solutionArray, comparing each index of solutionArray against the same index of guessArray . If the item matches, increment correctLetterLocations , and set that index in solutionArray to null .

Some of the most commonly used array methods are higher-order functions, or functions that take another function as one of their parameters. These functions are useful because they make your code more concise and easier to understand. Higher Order Functions(Methods) Intro There are many higher-order functions built into JavaScript that help make our code efficient, readable and reusable. For now, we will discuss three array methods that are higher-order functions: Array.prototype.forEach, Array.prototype.map , and Array.prototype.filter . As you begin to create more complex programs and work with single page applications such as React and Angular, these will be some of the most frequently used methods in your code. Array.prototype.forEach() The .forEach() method can be called on any array. The prototype you see is just the basis of the array in the language of JavaScript. For now, don't worry or focus your attention on prototype, this is something you can figure out later. It is irrelevant at the moment. .forEach() takes a callback function as its only parameter. This function iterates through all of the values in an array and uses the callback function passed to it to do something with the value. If you have ever used a for loop that looks something like this: for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){//do something} then you have essentially created the functionality of a forEach loop in long-hand. Here is an example of a forEach loop: 1 2 3 4 5 const colors = [ 'orange' , 'red' , 'blue' , 'yellow' , 'green' , 'purple' ]; colors . forEach (( color ) => { console . log ( `My favorite color is ${ color } ` ); }); Copy/paste the above code into a Repl.it and run it. You will notice that a sentence starting with \"My favorite color is\" gets logged to the console one time for each value in the array. Unlike the other two higher-order functions you will learn about in today's prep work, forEach will never be assigned to a new variable because it always returns undefined. Also notice the () => {} inside the () of the .forEach() . This () => {} is an anonymous function passed to the forEach. The parameter inside the () of the () => {} like color in the above example represents the individual element in the array as the forEach loops through the array. Array.prototype.map() The .map() method of an array is used to create a new array that is, in some way, a transformation of an existing array. Similarly to a forEach loop, it takes a callback function , () => {} , as its only parameter and passes every value/element in the array into the callback function. In the new array returned by the map method, each new value is assigned to be equal to whatever the callback function returns when passed the original value. Let's look at an example of a map function in action: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 const colors = [ 'orange' , 'red' , 'blue' , 'yellow' , 'green' , 'purple' ]; const tieDyes = colors . map (( color ) => { return `tieDyed- ${ color } ` ; }); console . log ( tieDyes ); Run the above code in a Repl.it. Notice that what is stored in the tieDye variable is an array that is equal in length to the colors array, but each value from the color array has been transformed to start with \"tieDyed-\" and end with the original color. If you will look at the code, you will see this is exactly what is returned in the callback function passed to colors.map . Video FunFunFunction - .map() Array.prototype.filter() The . filter() method does exactly what it sounds like it would do. It iterates through an array and returns only values that follow a specified rule. The filter method is passed a callback function as its only parameter. The filter method returns a new array by passing each value in the original array into the callback function. If the callback function returns true or any truthy value, that value is included in the new array, but if the callback function returns false or any falsy value, that value is not included in the new array. If all of the values passed into the callback function return a falsy value, then the filter method returns an empty array: [] . Let's look at an example of the filter method: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 const colors = [ 'orange' , 'red' , 'blue' , 'yellow' , 'green' , 'purple' ]; const sixOrMore = colors . filter (( color ) => { return color . length > 5 ; }); console . log ( sixOrMore ); //=> ['orange', 'yellow', 'purple'] Copy the above code and run it in a Repl.it. Notice that the new array is not equal in length to the original array. This is because the new array only included values which passed the test of containing strings with a length greater than five. For all of the words with five or fewer letters the callback function returned false and thus the values were not included in the new array.

It looks scary at first but it's actually really easy because it, itself, follows a pattern. You can use RegEx to quickly and efficiently find keywords or characters that you would otherwise have to type out manually.

We have just one more higher order function to cover: .reduce() . Like the other higher order functions we learned about, .reduce() takes a callback function, but instead of an argument representing each element it's iterating over in the array, the first argument in the callback is an accumulator. This accumulator keeps up with the total value of the elements it has iterated over and the current element respective of operations you put inside the callback function. Look at the example on the Mozilla docs on .reduce() . See how the accumulator and the currentValue are added together in the callback function on line 2, then how the callback function is passed to the .reduce() function on line 5?

Lewis Overview In the next class you'll be creating GUI s, or Graphical User Interfaces, for your Pig Latin and Tic Tac Toe apps. So far you've built those apps with a CLI, command line interface. Be sure to brush up on your DOM knowledge and skills. The DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of our webpage and our code in the index.html file. Think of it as a go-between. It has a memory of all the elements you've coded as well as all the texts and attributes. These \"memories\" are called nodes . The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects in an upside-down like tree so that programming languages can connect to the page to do interesting things with the elements. Therefore, each HTML tag you code is a node. Each attribute inside those tags is a node, and each text in between the tags is a node. The DOM, then, has access to all of these nodes and can do neat things with each one using built-in functions or methods. For instance, we can tell the browser to welcome the user to our website with a pop-up alert as soon as the page loads by including: <body onload=\"window.alert('Welcome to my home page!');\"> inside the opening body tag. Notice the attribute: onload ? This is just a built-in method telling the browser to do whatever is after the = when the page loads. Then, we see window that is telling the browser to access the window object of the webpage, which is the entire browser window. The . then tells the browser to go inside the window node and find something called alert() which is a built-in method. The () after the alert is how we invoke, or call, a method. To give the method/function the stuff we want it to do something with, we pass in an argument in between the ( and ) . In this case we're asking the alert() method/function to display: 'Welcome to my home page!' It's as simple as that! Try it yourself. Go to your landing page's index.html file and replace your opening body tag with this line of code: <body onload=\"window.alert('Welcome to my home page!');\"> Then try changing the text: \"Welcome to my home page!\". Run live-server and see what happens. Now google different methods you can call on for your <body/> element. Play around. Nerd out! This is how you get good! A very short, non-exhaustive, list of some of the built-in methods on the DOM: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 document . getElementById ( id ) document . getElementsByTagName ( name ) document . createElement ( name ) parentNode . appendChild ( node ) element . innerHTML element . style . left element . setAttribute () element . getAttribute () element . addEventListener () window . content window . onload window . dump () window . scrollTo () NOTE: While you've been coding HTML elements you have been blissfully unaware of these methods...until now\u2014but now you know that every element you build comes with these and many more methods baked right in! NOTE 2: A method is actually a little more than a function. It can be invoked like a function but because it is an object on another object, the Document, it is read and stored slightly differently than a function you build. This is a pretty advanced topic, so don't worry too much about it right now. However, if you'd like to learn more, you can read this forum to get a deeper understanding.

Algorithms! This is a fancy buzz word I'm sure you hear all the time. It may even strike a little fear or awe in you heart that either you don't know them or that only really smart people can build them. The truth is, an algorithm is simply a recipe. It's a list of tasks given to a computer to do in order, over and over again until the job is complete (the condition is met.) Today we're going to go over the most common and basic algorithms so you can get a feel for what they are before you start building your own and conquering the world!! See It - Algorithms Sorting Algorithms Algorithms are actually numbered and named like species of animals. Number one is bubble sort. Bubble Sort Bubble sort is the least efficient of algorithms in that it takes a longer time to do the task it accomplishes than another algorithm could do. The basis of this algorithm is that it checks to see if the number after another number is greater than the first number. If so, it moves on to the next number. If not, it switches the order and then moves to the next number. But this doesn't change the fact that the first numbers could still be greater than the ones we just switched. Because of this the computer has to loop back through the array and redo the tasks, over and over again until the entire array is in ascending (or descending) order. The video below uses Java to build this algorithm but you can do it for yourself in JavaScript. And you should in a new Repl.it. Insertion Sort With insertion sort , we start with a marker, telling us we have one number in the sort portion of the array. We then move over one number at a time to see if it's greater than the one to its left. If it's less, move it to the left of the number. We repeat this for each number in the unsorted part of the array. When the number is greater than the number it's compared to it stays in place and we grab the next unsorted number. Merge Sort For merge sort and quick sort we'll need to know something about a strange word called: recursion . We won't be covering this in class in detail for another week. For now, read this recursion article and make sure you understand that a function can call itself. In the following algorithms you'll need a function that can call itself if the condition is not met. NOTE: In this video, Rob works backwards to make sure we know how to merge two lists. Then he shows how to separate them before merging again. Quick Sort Like merge, quick sort uses a pivot element as a partition then looks at numbers to the left and right of the partition to see if they need to be moved over or not. Then it repeats the sequence on the left and right sides of the partitions. Then again and again until all the numbers are in order. BIG NOTE HERE: The woman in the video is Gayle Laakmann-McDowell .

If you haven't come across this word in your readings so far, you're doing well, don't worry. Closure refers to the scope of a variable, meaning: if it is accessible within a function, outside the function, or to other functions. In the most basic of terms scope is the area (or context) available for a function to access variables. You've probably heard of the global scope or local scope. You're using global scope when you install npm modules with: npm install lodash --global . This means that lodash, an npm package we'll work with at the end of 211 , would be available to every program on your computer. This isn't needed and we shouldn't do this because we only need it to be available to our program's scope, not our word processor or Chrome. But it works the same for the functions we build. When a function needs a variable it will look for the variable within its own context first . If it doesn't find it it will go up a level to its parent's scope. If it doesn't find it there it will go up to its grandparent's scope, and so on until it gets up to the global scope. Closure is a tricky concept to internalize and many developers don't understand it fully without years of practice. For now, give yourself a break and just try to be aware of what variables are available to a function. There is no substitute for the MDN Docs on JavaScript when you're learning JavaScript.

While this is partly true, it is very important for you to understand these concepts: OOP, functional programming, closure, class , constructors, function factories, bind , and this . Because these ideas can be complex and take time for one to construct a mental model of, we are covering them a little at a time, building up, gradually, your knowledge and understanding of each of them. Read It - OOP Object-oriented programming is a fundamental way to program. Most languages use this model, and JavaScript is no different. However, JavaScript is very different in that it also implements functional programming, but we won't get into all of its wonderful characteristics just yet. For now, let's get to what OOP (object-oriented programming) is. Let's say we want to build a bicycle. Before we go shopping for all of the pieces to build a bike, it would be a good idea to know what we will need for the bicycle. We could say we need a frame, wheels, seat, brakes, handlebars, and reflectors. Wonderful! Now we have a shopping list of the parts needed to build a bicycle. But what if now we wanted to build a new bicycle for each of our family members and friends? There really isn't a point in re-writing our shopping list for each bike. On top of that, each person might just want a different color of frame, type of wheels or handlebars! We could call these different colors and types values and the basic items we need properties or keys. Do you remember building objects before where we had key-value pairs? I hope so, because it's going to come in handy here. Let's build an object-literal called myBicycle : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 const myBicycle = { frame : \"green mountain\" , wheels : \"all-terrain\" , seat : \"soft leather\" , brakes : \"dual-discs\" , handlebars : \"straight\" , reflectors : 0 } Now we have an object that represents the bicycle I want to build, or a list of items to buy. But now Kate wants a blue bicycle with road touring wheels, a synthetic seat and horn shaped handlebars. Let's build a kateBicycle : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 const kateBicycle = { frame : \"blue road\" , wheels : \"road touring\" , seat : \"small synthetic\" , brakes : \"dual-discs\" , handlebars : \"horned\" , reflectors : 4 } Do you notice a pattern? Even as I typed this example, I copy/pasted the key-value pairs of myBicycle and changed the values for kateBicycle . It can get pretty old doing this over and over again (repeating ourselves), especially if we plan to build dozens of bicycles or have thousands of users on our app. The solution to this problem is object-oriented programming . We know what our object is going to look like so we build a class that can then be called over and over again to have new values put inside it. Here are all the parts of a bicycle that make up myBicycle and kateBicycle turned into a class : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 class Bicycle { constructor ( frame , wheels , seat , brakes , handlebars , reflectors ){ this . frame = frame ; this . wheels = wheels ; this . seat = seat ; this . brakes = brakes ; this . handlebars = handlebars ; this . reflectors = reflectors ; } } Let's take a minute to look at what we just did. First, we figured out the \"shopping-list\" we need to build a bicycle. Then we put all of the things into something called a class . After that we called it something generic like bicycle or user . Then we added a special method to it called constructor. Inside the ( arguments ) of the constructor we passed in all the things NEEDED to make a bicycle. This is the syntax you're going to be using. Just familiarize yourself with it and start memorizing it by typing it out each time to do the practice problems. Inside the code block of the constructor we have a weird word called this . You've seen this before but let's cover it again. this refers to this instance of the class . Think about it as a reference to the object as we pass through the class . A class is a function that returns an object. Each time we call the class bicycle we are going to pass through it declaring certain values to each of the keys. Remember the key-value pairs?? So on this next pass-through with the creation of myBicycle we'll assign values to it based on this instance of the pass-through. If we didn't have the this we wouldn't be able to use the class bicycle as a template to be used multiple times and still keep the memory of each bicycle we made like kateBicycle and momBicycle , etc. If you could talk to the constructor it might say something like this: \"Hey, I'm a constructor and I require a value for every argument inside my (). If you don't give a value for every argument I will assign undefined to the last arguments. Meaning, the order of the arguments matters! And if you want null for something you better put null in for the value.\" From here we can make new bicycles using the class bicycle object. Take a look below at how we call the class bicycle with the keyword new and pass in the values we want to assign it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 const myBicycle = new Bicycle ( \"Green-Mountain\" , \"All-Terrain\" , \"Soft-Leather\" , \"Dual-Discs\" , \"Straight\" , 0 ) console . log ( myBicycle . brakes ); // Dual-Discs console . log ( myBicycle . seat ); // Soft-Leather console . log ( myBicycle . reflectors ); // 0 console . log ( myBicycle . frame ); // Green-Mountain Notice the new keyword. I've made sure to bold all mentions of new throughout this text so you can anticipate a new thing being made with the keyword new . Above we're creating a variable called myBicycle and we're assigning it the value of a new object that has the same structure as class Bicycle and passing to the constructor the values we want to assign to each of the keys. After calling new Bicycle the way we did just above, we would have an object that looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 const myBicycle = { frame : \"green mountain\" , wheels : \"all-terrain\" , seat : \"soft leather\" , brakes : \"dual-discs\" , handlebars : \"straight\" , reflectors : 0 } Look familiar? We could do this again for Kate's bicycle: 1 2 3 const kateBicycle = new Bicycle ( \"blue road\" , \"road touring\" , \"small synthetic\" , \"dual-discs\" , \"horned\" , 4 ) console . log ( kateBicycle ) // => {frame: \"blue road\", wheels: \"road touring\", seat: \"small synthetic\", brakes: \"dual-discs\", handlebars: \"horned\", reflectors: 4 } In short, object-oriented programming allows us to type less, reuse more, standardize our data structures and pass objects to other objects. See It - OOP & Bind-This OOP In this video we see the big four of OOP and why it's useful. Follow along and notice the use of methods that are created on the objects. We didn't build methods on our class bicycle above but we could have!! Now might be a good time to introduce D.R.Y. In programming there are a few principles to follow while you build any program. As a noobie-developer it isn't so important to focus on these principles, so much as it is to be aware of them. This DRY principle simply says, D on't R epeat Y ourself! In the class bicycle example above, we could have created a new object for each bicycle manually but that would be R epeating ourselves. Instead, we build one template and call it each time we need to create a new bicycle object. Bind and This Pause and play it as you need. Really take the time to look at the code and figure out what each .bind() and this is doing.

Because these ideas can be complex and take time for one to construct a mental model of, we are covering them a little at a time, building up, gradually, your knowledge and understanding of each of them.","title":"Context of OOP"},{"location":"module-3/oop-pt1/#read-it-oop","text":"Object-oriented programming is a fundamental way to program. Most languages use this model, and JavaScript is no different. However, JavaScript is very different in that it also implements functional programming, but we won't get into all of its wonderful characteristics just yet. For now, let's get to what OOP (object-oriented programming) is. Let's say we want to build a bicycle. Before we go shopping for all of the pieces to build a bike, it would be a good idea to know what we will need for the bicycle. We could say we need a frame, wheels, seat, brakes, handlebars, and reflectors. Wonderful! Now we have a shopping list of the parts needed to build a bicycle. But what if now we wanted to build a new bicycle for each of our family members and friends? There really isn't a point in re-writing our shopping list for each bike. On top of that, each person might just want a different color of frame, type of wheels or handlebars! We could call these different colors and types values and the basic items we need properties or keys. Do you remember building objects before where we had key-value pairs? I hope so, because it's going to come in handy here. Let's build an object-literal called myBicycle : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 const myBicycle = { frame : \"green mountain\" , wheels : \"all-terrain\" , seat : \"soft leather\" , brakes : \"dual-discs\" , handlebars : \"straight\" , reflectors : 0 } Now we have an object that represents the bicycle I want to build, or a list of items to buy. But now Kate wants a blue bicycle with road touring wheels, a synthetic seat and horn shaped handlebars. Let's build a kateBicycle : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 const kateBicycle = { frame : \"blue road\" , wheels : \"road touring\" , seat : \"small synthetic\" , brakes : \"dual-discs\" , handlebars : \"horned\" , reflectors : 4 } Do you notice a pattern? Even as I typed this example, I copy/pasted the key-value pairs of myBicycle and changed the values for kateBicycle . It can get pretty old doing this over and over again (repeating ourselves), especially if we plan to build dozens of bicycles or have thousands of users on our app. The solution to this problem is object-oriented programming . We know what our object is going to look like so we build a class that can then be called over and over again to have new values put inside it. Here are all the parts of a bicycle that make up myBicycle and kateBicycle turned into a class : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 class Bicycle { constructor ( frame , wheels , seat , brakes , handlebars , reflectors ){ this . frame = frame ; this . wheels = wheels ; this . seat = seat ; this . brakes = brakes ; this . handlebars = handlebars ; this . reflectors = reflectors ; } } Let's take a minute to look at what we just did.

When you fill it with positive thoughts, your life will start to change. Overview We covered the the basics of object-oriented programming through very visual tasks and concrete ideas. Today we're going to go into a little more detail as to why OOP is a common paradigm of programming, including weird words like: _proto_ , prototype and prototypal inheritance . The meaning behind these words isn't absolutely necessary for you to understand at this very moment or this week, but it is important that you know of them because eventually, when you're a mid-level programmer, you will need to understand them to advance to the next stage of your career. Today, let's just get into what each are and what we can do with them now. proto vs prototype We won't spend too much time on this because it's an advanced subject in a very muddy part of JavaScript. If you remember in the pre-work to this class, JavaScript was a language that wasn't planned, designed and built well by a full team. It was, for the most part, hacked together because the internet was becoming a thing and the people at the time didn't understand the full capacity of the internet or how dependent we would be on JavaScript in the future. Because of that, the language has grown organically and, more or less, been patched as developers recognized flaws. Like null returns an object!?! This is actually a bug and can't be fixed else it would break the internet! Again, if you look at all these \"flaws\" as bits of character you can truly fall in love with this language and learn to enjoy these amusing quirks. For short, remember: _proto_ is a property on an object while prototype is a property on a function. These two properties are used by the objects and functions we create so that we have built-in methods that follow each of our objects or functions around. This following around is called delegation. The objects or functions you create don't have to be painstakingly written out to have all the methods we like to use. Remember when we learned the methods of an array like .split() , .pop() , etc.? The objects and functions we build can delegate the task of acquiring those fun and useful methods through the internal prototype chain. For now, don't worry about knowing all the ins-and-outs of the prototype chain . Just know 1) that it's there so when you need to access the _proto_ or prototype object you're not bewildered by it and 2) that inheritance should really be called delegation . Read It - proto vs prototype Forum, Quora - Prototypal Inheritance Blog, Medium - Master the JS Interview See It - proto vs prototype Object.create() The .create() method was added to JavaScript as a way to utilize prototype inheritance more effectively. Remember, prototype inheritance, or delegation, is useful to us not only because we can use the built-in methods but also because it builds faster in the JavaScript engine. All of the fun and useful methods we've grown to love don't have to be built again and again for every single object we make. Instead, we can just reference the methods we need, exactly when we need them through the prototype chain. However, there may be a case like: we want to add a specific method to an object that we will use multiple times throughout the app, just not on every object we make. We don't want to add it to the proto or prototype because then it would be added as a method for ALL of the objects in our app and slow down our JS engine making our app less performant[sic]. A work around is .create() . Object.create() lets us point the new object(s) we create in our app to another object to use as it's prototype. If you're lost, it's okay. This is tough stuff.

Coding is the process of communicating that solution for the computer to execute. Programming For the sake of the class I want you to think of programming as figuring out the steps of a process(program) and telling the computer in a very detailed, non-ambiguous way how to execute the steps in the process(program). In this way, you're looking at a problem from a higher point-of-view using your vision, hearing and even touch to figure out solutions to the problem and then to implement a process of steps whereby to arrive at the solution. For instance: A Simple Program Example Given a list of numbers: 2, 5, 6, 7 and 9, add 1 to each number and return a list of the new values and the sum of all of those new values Perfect! Let's walk through this step by step to see how we might program a solution to this problem. Our given input is [2, 5, 6, 7, 9] . We have the first action: add 1 to each number in the list. A second action: return the list of new numbers. And we have a third action: return the sum of the new list of numbers! We can even deduce another piece of the puzzle: If our input is a list of numbers like: [2, 5, 6, 7, 9] into our program, our expect output will be [3, 6, 7, 8, 10] with a sum value of 34 . Now that we know what our program's actions(steps) are and what the expected output or our program should be we can begin to reverse-engineer the solution. Action 1: add 1 to each number tell the computer to loop though the list of numbers and for each number add 1 to its value Action 2: return the list of new numbers collect the new values in another list [ ]in the return statement include the new list Action 3: Return the sum of the new list hold the value of the new numbers in a place in the return statement include the place you were holding sum of new numbers Hopefully, you can see now how we can approach any problem. We begin with a bigger view of the problem and work our way down to the small details of it. In this way we use our natural human ability to solve complex problems with mental models and abstraction then list them into short, clear directives to give to the computer. And this, for our purposes, is programming. We have been given a challenge and we found a solution and listed out the steps needed to make it a process. From here we can translate(code) it into any language we want: C, C++, C#, Python, Swift, Rust, Go, Dart, Java, Erlang, or Cobol. In the next section, we're going to translate(code)these steps into Javascript. What is Coding? As you just saw, programming is listing out all the steps a program will need to accomplish a task given by a human so that it can return an expected result. Coding , on the other hand, is the language we use to communicate to other humans our intent for a computer's task while also telling the computer what we expect it to repeat over and over in a precise and predictable way. It is also important to note that no coding language is actually what the computer reads. All languages are compiled down to binary , the language a computer can understand. Therefore, you could use nearly any language you want to accomplish most tasks. There are restrictions, of course (i.e. all front-end apps have to be written in JS), preferences (Python for analytics), and logistical things (full coverage testing, support, open-source, and technical cost) to consider but keep in mind, the characters ( tokens you type into the text editor) are not really read by the computer the same way you see them on the screen. Now we're going to turn those programming steps from the last section into JavaScript code so that a computer can complete the tasks we created for it. Below are the instructions we wrote out while learning to program , next to code that describes the action steps in JavaScript code.

Simple Coding Example Before we can perform Action 1, let's build a function (program/process) we can call to do something at some point. Let's call it: addOneWithSum 1 2 3 const addOneWithSum = () => { } Then let's make sure it can take in an array of numbers like the one given to us in the example above: const exampleArray = [2, 5, 6, 7, 9] 1 2 3 const addOneWithSum = ( ourArray ) => { } Now let's do Action 1: add 1 to each number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 const addOneWithSum = ( ourArray ) => { // tell the computer to loop though the list of numbers and for each number add 1 to its value for ( let i = 0 ; i < ourArray . length ; i ++ ) { ourArray [ i ] + 1 } } // More details: // the for() loop states: // let i = 0; - set i to 0, (i stands for iterator) // i < ourArray.length; - and while i is less than the length of ourArray keep doing what is inside the code block // i++ - and each time you loop through ourArray once add 1 to the value of i so that we keep iterating through all of the numbers in the list. // ourArray[i] + 1 - inside the {} of the for() loop we add 1 to each item in ourArray Action 2: return the list of new numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 const addOneWithSum = ( ourArray ) => { // collect the new values in another list(array) let newList = [] for ( let i = 0 ; i < ourArray . length ; i ++ ) { newList . push ( ourArray [ i ] + 1 ) } // in the return statement include the new list return newList } // let newList = [] - creates a place we can hold the new values of the list // newList.push(ourArray[i] + 1) - the .push() method pushes the new values into the newList array/list // return newList - and then we returned the newList as the output of this program Action 3: Return the sum of the new list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 const addOneWithSum = ( ourArray ) => { let newList = [] // hold the value of the new numbers in a place/variable let sum = 0 for ( let i = 0 ; i < ourArray . length ; i ++ ) { sum += ( ourArray [ i ] + 1 ) newList . push ( ourArray [ i ] + 1 ) } // in the return statement include the place you were holding sum of new numbers return newList + ' ' + sum } // let sum = 0 - Now we create a place to hold the sum of the new numbers: sum // sum += (ourArray[i] + 1) - and inside our for() loop we continually add to the value of sum // then we return sum as part of our output. // in the return we added a space, ' ' , between newList and sum so that the return would be easier to read. The final step to this is to feed our function(program) the input and call our newly built function(program): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 const exampleArray = [ 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 ] const addOneWithSum = ( ourArray ) => { let newList = [] let sum = 0 for ( let i = 0 ; i < ourArray . length ; i ++ ) { sum += ( ourArray [ i ] + 1 ) newList . push ( ourArray [ i ] + 1 ) } return newList + ' ' + sum } addOneWithSum ( exampleArray ) Practice It Throw this code into a repl.it and practice for yourself! Solve this problem: given an array of numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], divide each number by two, return the new array and the product (multiplied all together) of the new array.

Let's walk through this step by step to see how we might program a solution to this problem. Our given input is [2, 5, 6, 7, 9] . We have the first action: add 1 to each number in the list. A second action: return the list of new numbers. And we have a third action: return the sum of the new list of numbers! We can even deduce another piece of the puzzle: If our input is a list of numbers like: [2, 5, 6, 7, 9] into our program, our expect output will be [3, 6, 7, 8, 10] with a sum value of 34 . Now that we know what our program's actions(steps) are and what the expected output or our program should be we can begin to reverse-engineer the solution. Action 1: add 1 to each number tell the computer to loop though the list of numbers and for each number add 1 to its value Action 2: return the list of new numbers collect the new values in another list [ ]in the return statement include the new list Action 3: Return the sum of the new list hold the value of the new numbers in a place in the return statement include the place you were holding sum of new numbers Hopefully, you can see now how we can approach any problem. We begin with a bigger view of the problem and work our way down to the small details of it. In this way we use our natural human ability to solve complex problems with mental models and abstraction then list them into short, clear directives to give to the computer. And this, for our purposes, is programming. We have been given a challenge and we found a solution and listed out the steps needed to make it a process. From here we can translate(code) it into any language we want: C, C++, C#, Python, Swift, Rust, Go, Dart, Java, Erlang, or Cobol. In the next section, we're going to translate(code)these steps into Javascript.","title":"A Simple Program Example"},{"location":"preCourse/codingAndProgramming/#what-is-coding","text":"As you just saw, programming is listing out all the steps a program will need to accomplish a task given by a human so that it can return an expected result. Coding , on the other hand, is the language we use to communicate to other humans our intent for a computer's task while also telling the computer what we expect it to repeat over and over in a precise and predictable way. It is also important to note that no coding language is actually what the computer reads. All languages are compiled down to binary , the language a computer can understand. Therefore, you could use nearly any language you want to accomplish most tasks. There are restrictions, of course (i.e. all front-end apps have to be written in JS), preferences (Python for analytics), and logistical things (full coverage testing, support, open-source, and technical cost) to consider but keep in mind, the characters ( tokens you type into the text editor) are not really read by the computer the same way you see them on the screen.

Non-Equality Operators Th equality operators == and === are simply checking if both operands are equal to one another.

Both operands on either side must be truthy for the operation to evaluate to true , otherwise, the operation evaluates to false . But what about the opposite? What if we wanted to do something if the evaluation was false? Enter the bang : ! . To evaluate if something is false you can use the bang-equal operators, != / !== . This simply says, \"if these don't equal each other do something\".

With this very simple program we can learn quite a bit. First, 7 is a Number, 54 is a Number, and + and = are both functions. This means we're using two different types of data: type Number and type Function.

All the things you see on your screen and the information you send and receive online comes in the form of different types of data. We call these types of data data types . How Many Data Types There are seven main data types in JavaScript in total. We can divide them into two main categories: Complex and Primitive . The Primitive Types String , i.e. \"cat\" , \"dog\" , \"700\" , \"Peter woke at 9 a.m.\" Number , i.e. 70 , 43 , 2 , 10000000 , -1 , 0 Boolean , i.e. true or false Undefined , i.e. undefined (literally undefined) The Complex Types Function , i.e. const add = (num1, num2) => { return num1 + num2 } Object , i.e. const vehicle = {color: \"red\", wheels: 4} Array , i.e. const passengers = [\"David\", \"Julia\", \"Pete\"] There is also \"Not a Number\" - NaN , which technically isn't a primitive or complex type but we'll talk about it when we need to. It occurs when you try to add \"cat\" to 54. Each of the data types can hold specific types of values but also come with special built in methods we can use to compare and manipulate them. For instance, Number type data can be calculated but String type data can't be calculated. And Array type data can be looped over but Functions types can't.

The ECMA-262 made its first edition in 1997 and its latest edition came out in June 2018: ES2018 (ES9). The reason we're talking about ES6 and not ES9 here is that ES6 was the biggest renovation of the language and is now the standard of the language used across multiple platforms. While there are newer features in the newer editions it is important to remember that the engines that run JavaScript, like Chrome V8 JS Engine , have to all be updated for these newer features, so each platform can talk back and forth to one another. This process takes time so the official edition of the language in use is always a few years behind where the latest edition actually is. Note on transpiling(sic) from Wikipedia : Since ES 2015, transpiling JavaScript has become very common. Transpilation is a source to source compilation in which the newer versions of JavaScript are used in the user's source code and the transpiler rewrites them so that they are compliant with the current specification. Usually, transpilers transpile down to ES3 to maintain compatibility with all versions of browsers. The settings to transpiling to a specific version can be configured according to need. Transpiling adds an extra step to the build process and is sometimes done to avoid needing polyfills. Polyfills allow adding extra functionalities by including another JavaScript file which adds those specific functionalities.

You'll see your first assignment, CurrentDate & Time , asks for you to \"Write a JavaScript program that...\". This means you need to write a program that can be executed , or called , or what we like to say: invoked . These programs can be complex with many functions that call each other or they can be incredibly simple like the ones this assignment asks for. Today we'll focus on the very simplest of programs/functions. What are Functions Functions are executable blocks of code. They are used to performed predetermined tasks and return a value that can be captured and used by other functions. Think of a function as a recipe. Specifically let's think of it as a cocktail recipe so our bartender can call upon it and make us an old fashioned when we order one. From across the bar top we can call our bartender and order/ invoke an oldFashioned(). Then the bartender ( JavaScript Engine/Web Browser ) can find the recipe/ function , read the recipe/ function and then perform the predetermined tasks specified in the function. Let's see how that could work. Read the lines of code to see how a function's syntax is written, as well as the comments to see what is happening: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // create a function called gatherIngredients which takes a cocktail name as a parameter const gatherIngredients = ( typeOfCocktail ) = { return typeOfCocktail . listOfIngredients } // invoke the function and pass in oldFashioned as an argument and save that to a variable named oldFashionedIngredients const oldFashionedIngredients = gatherIngredients ( oldFashioned ) // this will return a list of ingredients so oldFashionedIngredients now equals a list/array of recipes. const oldFashionedIngredients = [{ 1 1 / 2 oz Bourbon }, { Angostura bitters }, { A Sugar cube }, { Water }, { Ice Cubes }, { Old Fashioned glass }, { Cocktail cherry }] Obviously the words above are not real words in JavaScript, but they get the idea through if you really read through them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 // Hold the ingredients needed to build an old fashioned const oldFashionedIngredients = [ { 1 1 / 2 oz Bourbon }, { Angostura bitters }, { A Sugar cube }, { Water }, { Ice Cubes }, { Old Fashioned glass }, { Cocktail cherry } ] // then create the instructions to build an old fashioned which takes a list of ingredients as a parameter const buildAnOldFashioned = (... ingredients ) => { Place sugar cube in old fashioned glass (); then (); saturate with bitters (); then (); add a dash of plain water (); then (); Muddle until dissolved (); then (); Fill the glass with ice cubes (); then (); pour 1.5 ounce whiskey in to Old Fashioned glass (); finally (); Garnish with cocktail cherry (); return cocktail to guest (); } // pass the ingredients as an argument into the function to invoke the function buildAnOldFashioned ( oldFashionedIngredients ); You see, a function is just a recipe, written somewhere in a file, held in the memory of the computer, so it can be called/executed/invoked with certain ingredients/ arguments to return a desired result. Put another way, functions provide a way for us to perform the same task with any set of parameters , over and over. Think of a calculator which has a few simple functions (+, -, /, *) that are used over and over again with different arguments/numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). All other functions work this same way!! Rules About Functions Functions must FIRST be declared before they can be invoked . Function declaration: const myFunc = (arg1) => { return arg1 + 2} Function invocations: myFunc(15), myFunc(10), myFunc(20) The returns of these functions would be: 17, 12 and 22 Functions must return something. Functions are camelCased just like variables. Functions should be named descriptively for their purposes and the data types that they return, i.e. isValidInput(input1) would be a function that evaluates if a value is true or false and it would return a Boolean type value. sumOfTwoNumbers(num1, num2) would be a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum. You can recognize when a function is being used by recognizing the () , examples: sumOfTwoNumbers(3, 4) - is a function that is being invoked/called/executed const divideTwoNumbers = (num1, num2) => { num1/num2} - is a function that is being declared/defined More Examples Below is a JavaScript program called sumOfTwoNumbers that returns the sum of two numbers and is being called twice with different arguments. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // declaration with two parameters const sumOfTwoNumbers = ( num1 , num2 ) => { return num1 + num2 ; } // invocation with two arguments sumOfTwoNumbers ( 7 , 9 ) // => 16 sumOfTwoNumbers ( 300 , 400000 ); // => 400300 In the example below we see that function declarations have parameters but when we invoke a function we \"pass in\" arguments . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // Declare the function with parameters: a and b const productOfTwoNumbers = ( a , b ) => { const product = a * b ; return product + \" Yay! You returned something!\" ; } // Invoke the function with two arguments: 2 and 8 productOfTwoNumbers ( 2 , 8 ); Below, loadContent is a function, written in an o= older version of JavaScript that is being declared. Notice the function keyword. 1 2 3 4 function loadContent ( user ) { return \"content loaded\" } And this example is written the same way and also being invoked. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 // the function declaration comes first function ourFunFunc () { return \"Thanks for putting me above where you invoked me\" ; } // Invoke the function below it ourFunFunc (); STOP !!! There's something that must be discussed! So far you've seen function signatures as: 1 const ourFunFunc = () => { } But just now you saw: 1 2 function ourFunFunc () { } What gives? Well, the one with the const is the newer and more preferred way of writing a function signature . Under the hood it provides better scope but that's not something you should worry about right now. We need you to be familiar with both because you will see both in the wild. However, get comfortable with using const functionName instead of the keyword function .

Be sure to read the bullet points, they could help you in an interview someday... May-Dec 1995 Netscape Communicator and NCSA Mosaic were the first popular web browsers. Netscape was founded by the same people that built Mosaic, but now had money and time to build it better. Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape Communications wanted the web to become more dynamic. Animations, interaction and other forms of small automation should be part of the web of the future. To do that they would need a small scripting language that could interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) (which was not set in stone as it is right now). And it should be accessible to non-developers, better yet for designers the way HTML already was. And so the idea of Mocha was born. Mocha was to become a scripting language for the web. Simple, dynamic, and accessible to non-developers. Brendan Eich , father of JavaScript, was contracted by Netscape Communications to develop a \"Scheme for the browser\". This Scheme was to be dynamic, powerful, and functional in nature, easy to grasp syntactically and to reduce verbosity and speed up development. There was a lot of pressure to come up with a working prototype as soon as possible. The Java (not JS!) language was starting to get traction. Sun Microsystems was making a big push for it and Netscape Communications was about to close a deal with them to make Java available in the browser. Enter a new language, Mocha. The idea at the time was that Java was not suited for the type of audience that would consume Mocha: Scripters, amateurs, designers. Java was just too big, too enterprisy (sic) for the role. There was a lot of internal pressure to pick one language as soon as possible. Python , Tcl and Scheme itself were all possible candidates. So Eich had to work fast. May 1995 - Eich had the luxury to choose features but had little time to build the language. In a matter of weeks, a working prototype was integrated into Netscape Communicator in May 1995. In the end, a Java-like syntax was required, and familiar semantics for many common idioms was also adopted. So Mocha was not like Scheme at all. It looked like a dynamic Java, but underneath it was a very different beast: a premature lovechild of Scheme and Self , with Java looks. Mocha was renamed to LiveScript . And later when Sun and Netscape closed the deal it was renamed JavaScript, a scripting language for small client-side tasks. Java would be promoted as a bigger, professional tool to develop rich web components. This first version of JavaScript set in stone many of the traits the language is known for today. In particular, its object-model , and its functional features were already present in this first version. August 1996 - At the moment (and for a very long time), web standards were not strong. So Microsoft implemented its own version of JavaScript, called JScript. JScript was different in more than just name. Slight differences in implementation, in particular with regards to certain DOM functions, caused ripples that would still be felt many years into the future. JavaScript wars were fought in more fronts than just names and timelines and many of its quirks are just the wounds of these wars. The first version of JScript was included with Internet Explorer 3.0, released in August 1996. In the fall of 1996, Eich rewrote most of Mocha into a cleaner implementation to pay off for the technical debt caused by rushing it out of the door. This new version of Netscape's JavaScript engine was called SpiderMonkey . SpiderMonkey is still the name of the JavaScript engine found in Firefox, Netscape Navigator's grandson.

In the end, a Java-like syntax was required, and familiar semantics for many common idioms was also adopted. So Mocha was not like Scheme at all. It looked like a dynamic Java, but underneath it was a very different beast: a premature lovechild of Scheme and Self , with Java looks. Mocha was renamed to LiveScript . And later when Sun and Netscape closed the deal it was renamed JavaScript, a scripting language for small client-side tasks. Java would be promoted as a bigger, professional tool to develop rich web components. This first version of JavaScript set in stone many of the traits the language is known for today. In particular, its object-model , and its functional features were already present in this first version. August 1996 - At the moment (and for a very long time), web standards were not strong. So Microsoft implemented its own version of JavaScript, called JScript. JScript was different in more than just name. Slight differences in implementation, in particular with regards to certain DOM functions, caused ripples that would still be felt many years into the future. JavaScript wars were fought in more fronts than just names and timelines and many of its quirks are just the wounds of these wars. The first version of JScript was included with Internet Explorer 3.0, released in August 1996. In the fall of 1996, Eich rewrote most of Mocha into a cleaner implementation to pay off for the technical debt caused by rushing it out of the door. This new version of Netscape's JavaScript engine was called SpiderMonkey . SpiderMonkey is still the name of the JavaScript engine found in Firefox, Netscape Navigator's grandson.

The Flipped Classroom: Why In the traditional classroom , the teacher is the central focus of a lesson. The teacher responds to questions while students defer directly to the teacher for guidance and feedback. In a classroom with a traditional style of instruction, individual lessons may be focused on an explanation of content utilizing a lecture-style. Typically, this pattern of teaching also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practicing a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school. In a flipped classroom students are required to study the content of the lecture outside of class by reading, watching videos and fiddling with code. Class time with the instructor is then mostly reserved for questions over the content, small discussions of related topics and then dedicated guided practice time on each project. This way students get access to a professional programmer when they need it, during problems and struggles. This approach may feel difficult at first but this methodology has been proven to work and is well suited for both adult learners and part-time education.

A Boolean is darn simple, it can only be one of two things: true or false! Let's say that again, a Boolean data type can only be true or false. That's it. It may sound simple, but really, Booleans are the most useful of the data types because they determine on/off, yes/no, do/do not so all other data types can be used. Take a look... What's False and What's True? All values in JavaScript can be summed up as having a true or false value. That is to say, all values can be evaluated as either having a true value or a false value. We often use the terms \"truthy\" or \"falsey\" to say this very thing. A 0 will evaluate to false while a 1 would be evaluated as true . However, a pure Boolean value just means it's either true or false . The code snippet below shows two variables that hold these two different values: 1 2 const myVariableOne = true const myVariableTwo = false But when we're asking if another value is \"truthy\" or \"falsey\" it just means what is the value of the value or is the value actually there (does it actually exist). Let's start with \"falsey\" values. Here is a complete list of ALL JavaScript values that will evaluate to \"falsey\": undefined , NaN , Null , 0 , -0 , false , '' or \"\" ( empty strings ) This means that LITERALLY every other value in JavaScript (literally everything else) will evaluate to \"truthy\". ie. true , 10 , \"name\" , '.'. The Power of Booleans in JavaScript Think about the process of signing into your favorite app. When you type your username and password in, the front-end app sends that information to the server which has to use your username to pull your info out of a database and compare your inputted password to your actual password that's saved in the database. If the two passwords match, this is a true evaluation and you can be logged into your account. If not, that would be a false value. While programming we will perform various evaluations on Boolean values , in order to produce some kind of result. When properly implemented, they're kind of like asking a \"yes or no\" question about some piece of data at a particular point in your application. When we get a \"yes/no\" answer we can then start performing \"if/else\" procedures. Do you see where this is going yet? Back to that sign-in process. We could write: 1 2 3 4 5 if ( inputtedPassword === actualPassword ) { return logUserIn () } else { return \"Wrong username or password. Please try again.\" } We'll talk about if/else statements, also known as conditional statements , in a few lessons, but by now you might be able to see why we need to have and to use Boolean values. The Comparison Operators As you learned in the last section the = is known as the assignment operator because it points, or assigns value to a variable. We still need to compare values so let's look at how we can do that. The Double-Equals \"==\" vs the Triple-Equals \"===\" If we want to compare values we'll need to use two variations of the equal sign: == , checks if two values are equal. === , first checks if two values are of the same type then checks if the values are equal. The two tokens/symbols above are doing two different things but also the same thing. One is checking if things are equal, ==. BUT, because JavaScript likes to coerce data types, we have to use the === on occasion to first check the type of data then to check the equality of the values. Check out the examples below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 64 == '64' // true 64 == 'sixty-four' // false // the string 'sixty-four' won't be coerced but '64' will be 64 === '64' // false // 64 is of type Number where '64' is of type String so they are not equal in the strictest sense Let's look at each a little more closely on an individual basis. Value Only Comparison, \"==\" The == is used to compare values. 1 2 3 'blue' == 'blue' // true // or 'blue' == 'black' // false Above we see that the string blue equals blue but does not equal black . Now that you have that down, check this craziness out. Below, the string '3' equals the number 3 : 1 3 == '3' // true If you use the == in a comparison like the one above, JavaScript will try to coerce the String type of '3' into a Number type 3 and then compare the two. Again, JavaScript will try to change the string of \"3\" to the number of 3 and will result in the comparison being true . There is a big problem here. JS is type switching the type of one of our pieces of data and we don't want that!! This can result in poor program behavior, or side-effects . Because of this problem, there was a patch to the JavaScript language which introduced the Identity Operator , or Strictly Equals (slang): === . Strictly Equals: \"===\" To fix this problem of type switching or type coercion we use the identity operator . It looks like this: === . And it not only evaluates equality but also evaluates type of data, first. That is, it won't perform an evaluation unless the data types first match each other. Therefore: 1 3 === '3' // false Strictly equals === is much safer, since each operand gets tested by its data type first . 1 2 1 === '1' // false 1 === 1 // true This doesn't mean you can't use == but you will hear most developers say that you can't. Word to the wise, always know what you're writing and what you intend it to do. If you feel a == works in the case do it. Otherwise, stay with the safer === . This will be a debate you'll have for years to come. Practice It Read the code below and try to guess what the console.log will be. In other words, what will each line log out? Copy the console logs below and paste them into your text-editor and run them. Why do you think line 9 and 10 logged out different values? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 console . log ( \"line 1 is: \" + ( 1 === 1 )); console . log ( 2 === 1 ); console . log ( \"yes\" === \"yes\" ); console . log ( \"yes\" === \"no\" ); console . log ( \"line 5 is: \" + ( true === true )); console . log ( true === false ); console . log ( 1.2 === 1.2 ); console . log ( 1.2 === 1.20 ); console . log ( \"line 9 is: \" + ( 12 === '12' )); console . log ( \"line 10 is: \" + ( 12 == '12' )); NOTE: console.log() - the console is your \"terminal\" object in your browser and .log() is a built-in method that prints information on it.

A 0 will evaluate to false while a 1 would be evaluated as true . However, a pure Boolean value just means it's either true or false . The code snippet below shows two variables that hold these two different values: 1 2 const myVariableOne = true const myVariableTwo = false But when we're asking if another value is \"truthy\" or \"falsey\" it just means what is the value of the value or is the value actually there (does it actually exist). Let's start with \"falsey\" values. Here is a complete list of ALL JavaScript values that will evaluate to \"falsey\": undefined , NaN , Null , 0 , -0 , false , '' or \"\" ( empty strings ) This means that LITERALLY every other value in JavaScript (literally everything else) will evaluate to \"truthy\". ie. true , 10 , \"name\" , '.'.","title":"What's False and What's True?"},{"location":"preCourse/typeBoolean/#the-power-of-booleans-in-javascript","text":"Think about the process of signing into your favorite app. When you type your username and password in, the front-end app sends that information to the server which has to use your username to pull your info out of a database and compare your inputted password to your actual password that's saved in the database. If the two passwords match, this is a true evaluation and you can be logged into your account. If not, that would be a false value. While programming we will perform various evaluations on Boolean values , in order to produce some kind of result. When properly implemented, they're kind of like asking a \"yes or no\" question about some piece of data at a particular point in your application. When we get a \"yes/no\" answer we can then start performing \"if/else\" procedures. Do you see where this is going yet? Back to that sign-in process. We could write: 1 2 3 4 5 if ( inputtedPassword === actualPassword ) { return logUserIn () } else { return \"Wrong username or password. Please try again.\" } We'll talk about if/else statements, also known as conditional statements , in a few lessons, but by now you might be able to see why we need to have and to use Boolean values.","title":"The Power of Booleans in JavaScript"},{"location":"preCourse/typeBoolean/#the-comparison-operators","text":"As you learned in the last section the = is known as the assignment operator because it points, or assigns value to a variable.

The two tokens/symbols above are doing two different things but also the same thing. One is checking if things are equal, ==. BUT, because JavaScript likes to coerce data types, we have to use the === on occasion to first check the type of data then to check the equality of the values. Check out the examples below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 64 == '64' // true 64 == 'sixty-four' // false // the string 'sixty-four' won't be coerced but '64' will be 64 === '64' // false // 64 is of type Number where '64' is of type String so they are not equal in the strictest sense Let's look at each a little more closely on an individual basis.","title":"The Double-Equals \"==\" vs the Triple-Equals \"===\""},{"location":"preCourse/typeBoolean/#value-only-comparison","text":"The == is used to compare values. 1 2 3 'blue' == 'blue' // true // or 'blue' == 'black' // false Above we see that the string blue equals blue but does not equal black . Now that you have that down, check this craziness out. Below, the string '3' equals the number 3 : 1 3 == '3' // true If you use the == in a comparison like the one above, JavaScript will try to coerce the String type of '3' into a Number type 3 and then compare the two. Again, JavaScript will try to change the string of \"3\" to the number of 3 and will result in the comparison being true . There is a big problem here. JS is type switching the type of one of our pieces of data and we don't want that!! This can result in poor program behavior, or side-effects . Because of this problem, there was a patch to the JavaScript language which introduced the Identity Operator , or Strictly Equals (slang): === .","title":"Value Only Comparison, \"==\""},{"location":"preCourse/typeBoolean/#strictly-equals","text":"To fix this problem of type switching or type coercion we use the identity operator . It looks like this: === . And it not only evaluates equality but also evaluates type of data, first. That is, it won't perform an evaluation unless the data types first match each other. Therefore: 1 3 === '3' // false Strictly equals === is much safer, since each operand gets tested by its data type first . 1 2 1 === '1' // false 1 === 1 // true This doesn't mean you can't use == but you will hear most developers say that you can't. Word to the wise, always know what you're writing and what you intend it to do. If you feel a == works in the case do it. Otherwise, stay with the safer === . This will be a debate you'll have for years to come.","title":"Strictly Equals: \"===\""},{"location":"preCourse/typeBoolean/#practice-it","text":"Read the code below and try to guess what the console.log will be.

Often times we wouldn't know what type of data is coming back to us because, as front-end developers, we usually don't build the back-end that we pull the data from.

This presents problems because if the object we're trying to access is of type Array it won't have the same methods built into it as a standard JS object, and vice versa. To tell us what type of data we're working with we use the typeof operator. How Does it Work? The typeof operator simply returns the data type of a variable or JavaScript object. Using typeof is just like asking the JavaScript engine: \"What type of data is this thing?\" It's really useful when you get into the end of this 211 course and all of 311 because you will be requesting \"things\" (objects) from a remote database and you won't know exactly what type of data you're getting back...maybe it's a string, ...maybe it's a number, ...maybe it's an object-literal!
