Today we're going to:
  
*OBJECTIVE: By re-engaging with previously learned knowledge and applying it to a new challenge the student will deepen their understanding and be prepared to creatively reuse these techniques in new ways.*

### Questions for Student Led Discussion, 15 mins
<!-- This section should be structured with the 5E model: https://lesley.edu/article/empowering-students-the-5e-model-explained -->

### Interview Challenge, 15 mins
<!-- The last two E happen here: elaborate and evaluate  -->
<!-- this sections should have a challenge that can be solved with the skills they've learned since their last class. -->

### Student Presentations, 15 mins

[See Student Presentations List](./../additionalResources/studentPresentations.md)

## Creation Time, 60-90 minutes

Today you'll practice array methods, as well as attaching your Tic Tac Toe logic to an index.html file so your user can have a friendlier interaction with your applications moving forward.

### Part 1 of 3: Array of Cars Practice

- [ ] Clone [ArrayOfCars Repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/JS211_ArrayPractice).
- [ ] Go to the `README.md` file and follow the directions

### Part 2 of 3: TTT GUI

Students will build the Tic Tac Toe application again but this time using the logic built in the last class.

- [ ] Begin by whiteboarding and code planning the application.
- [ ] Open your Tic Tac Toe app from last week.
From the `master` branch, create a new branch called: 'TicTacToe-GUI'
- [ ] Use the project you built in Web 101 as a reference, but now build it with the idea of logic first then front-end representation.
- [ ] How do you get your HTML file to talk to your JS file?

<!-- #### HIDDEN CONTENT - Legacy Perhaps 

NOTE TO EDITOR: I hid this from learners because of the very last line, which says  "Check out index.html for an idea . . .", but offers no link or explanation for what that index.html file might be (not even in the Campus Manager version). In the version visible to learners I simply removed the line, but didn't want the reference to disappear forever in case there is an appropriate index.html file that should be linked. Thanks! - Rob Watkins.

### Part 3 of 3: Pig Latin GUI

Connect your Pig Latin application to a GUI

- [ ] Begin by whiteboarding and code planning the application.
- [ ] Open your Pig Latin app from last week.
- [ ] From the `master`/`main` branch, create a new branch called: `PigLatin-GUI`
- [ ] Start by making sure you have a place for the user to input a word, then a submit button, then a place for the output to be displayed.
- [ ] How do you get your HTML file to talk to your JS file?
- [ ] Further practice: make your app handle sentences and paragraphs at a time like this [one](https://funtranslations.com/pig-latin).

<!-- ## Blogs to Show You Know    EVEN CLASSES ONLY 

Every other class will end with a discussion over these questions. If you have no idea about them, ask your instructor. Nevertheless, you will need to research the topics on your own and record what you learned in a blog. You will then turn in a link with the url of the published blog in Zollege. Feel free to copy/paste the question into google and read about what comes up. These interview questions are meant to broaden your knowledge and cover more ground than we can possibly get to in these few weeks. We want you to be well prepared for the rigors of interviewing for development jobs and knowing the answers to these questions will ensure that you have every tool you need to succeed!
