Today we're going to:
  
*OBJECTIVE: By re-engaging with previously learned knowledge and applying it to a new challenge the student will deepen their understanding and be prepared to creatively reuse these techniques in new ways.*

### Questions for Student Led Discussion, 15 mins
<!-- This section should be structured with the 5E model: https://lesley.edu/article/empowering-students-the-5e-model-explained -->

[Questions to prompt discussion](./../additionalResources/questionsForDiscussion/qfd-class-5.md)


### Interview Challenge, 15 mins
<!-- The last two E happen here: elaborate and evaluate  -->
<!-- this sections should have a challenge that can be solved with the skills they've learned since their last class. -->

### Student Presentations, 15 mins

[See Student Presentations List](./../additionalResources/studentPresentations.md)

## Creation Time, 60-90 minutes

Today you'll practice array methods, as well as attaching your Tic Tac Toe logic to an index.html file so your user can have a friendlier interaction with your applications moving forward.

### Part 1 of 3: Array of Cars Practice

- [ ] Clone [ArrayOfCars Repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/JS211_ArrayPractice).
- [ ] Go to the `README.md` file and follow the directions

### Part 2 of 3: TTT GUI

Students will build the Tic Tac Toe application again but this time using the logic built in the last class.

- [ ] Begin by whiteboarding and code planning the application.
- [ ] Open your Tic Tac Toe app from last week.
From the `master` branch, create a new branch called: 'TicTacToe-GUI'
- [ ] Use the project you built in Web 101 as a reference, but now build it with the idea of logic first then front-end representation.
- [ ] How do you get your HTML file to talk to your JS file?

<!-- #### HIDDEN CONTENT - Legacy Perhaps 

NOTE TO EDITOR: I hid this from learners because of the very last line, which says  "Check out index.html for an idea . . .", but offers no link or explanation for what that index.html file might be (not even in the Campus Manager version). In the version visible to learners I simply removed the line, but didn't want the reference to disappear forever in case there is an appropriate index.html file that should be linked. Thanks! - Rob Watkins.

### Part 3 of 3: Pig Latin GUI

Connect your Pig Latin application to a GUI

- [ ] Begin by whiteboarding and code planning the application.
- [ ] Open your Pig Latin app from last week.
- [ ] From the `master`/`main` branch, create a new branch called: `PigLatin-GUI`
- [ ] Start by making sure you have a place for the user to input a word, then a submit button, then a place for the output to be displayed.
- [ ] How do you get your HTML file to talk to your JS file?

### Additional Resources

- [ ] [Video, DevTips - JS & the DOM 1/2](https://youtu.be/hM9h1wN4rfU)

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Make your app handle sentences and paragraphs at a time like this [one](https://funtranslations.com/pig-latin).
