### Questions for Student Led Discussion, 15 mins
<!-- This section should be structured with the 5E model: https://lesley.edu/article/empowering-students-the-5e-model-explained -->

[Questions to prompt discussion](./../additionalResources/questionsForDiscussion/qfd-class-8.md)

### Interview Challenge, 15 mins
<!-- The last two E happen here: elaborate and evaluate  -->
<!-- this sections should have a challenge that can be solved with the skills they've learned since their last class. -->

### Student Presentations, 15 mins

[See Student Presentations List](./../additionalResources/studentPresentations.md)

## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

* Instructor to Demonstrate with Examples, Explain and Set Expectations
* Group Students in 3s
  * plan and implements
* Partner with other groups for elaboration
* Share with the class for evaluation (potentially carry into the next class)

By now you should be fairly familiar with loops; however, you can never get enough practice! Loops are used all the time and you should get used to using them and very comfortable with implementing them.

- [ ] Create a new repo & Clone it
- [ ] Create a branch called `loops` off of `master`.

Complete each of the following exercises:

- [ ] Use a do...while loop to `console.log` the numbers from 1 to 1000.
- [ ] Create an object (with keys and values) called person with the following data:
    * [ ] `firstName: "Jane",`
    * [ ] `lastName: "Doe",`
    * [ ] `birthDate: "Jan 5, 1925",`
    * [ ] `gender: "female"`
- [ ] Create a function that logs out the keys of the object using `Object.keys()`.
- [ ] Create a function that logs out the keys and values of the object using `Object.entries()`.
- [ ] Create an `arrayOfPersons` that contains multiple "people" objects. You can simply copy/paste the person object you made above multiple times. Feel free to change the values to reflect multiple people you might have in your database.
- [ ] Create a function that uses a for...of loop and an if statement to `console.log `the value associated with the key birthDate of each object if the birth year is an odd number.
- [ ] Use `.map()` to map over the `arrayOfPersons` and `console.log()` their information.
- [ ] Use `.filter()` to filter the persons array and `console.log` 0only males in the array.
- [ ] Create a function that returns true if the value of `birthDate` is before Jan 1, 1990.
- [ ] Use `.filter()` to filter the `persons` array and `console.log` only people that were born before Jan 1, 1990.
- [ ] **BONUS** - Create a function that returns true if the date passed to it is `>= 21` years in the past.
- [ ] **BONUS** - `.filter()` out the people in the array who are younger than 21.

### Pt. 2 - From Scratch .find() & .findIndex()

- [ ] Whiteboard
- [ ] Code plan
- [ ] Pseudo code
- [ ] JavaScript code in a Repl.it for both functions
- [ ] Turn in URL of Repl.it

### Push Yourself Further

When searching for specific data, [regular expression or RegEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) is a useful tool to know how to use. Paired with the methods you've been practicing lately, you will be a JavaScript ninja in no time.

We're only going to introduce RegEx briefly. It's a subject for you to truly learn only on your own. This is by no means a requirement to pass this course or to graduate. But eventually you will want to know and use RegEx professionally. Do yourself a favor and add [reading and practicing RegEx](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) to your daily exercises.

```javascript
  var re = /p+l/;
  const re = new RegEx('p+l')

  // the two expressions above both match the 'ppl' in 'apple' and the 'pl' in 'people'
  // the '+' looks for one or as many instances of the character that precedes it. In this case it's 'p'.
```
