While you will be learning the basics of programming and coding in JavaScript/Node in this course it is important to understand bigger concepts that apply to software development teams. One of these includes [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) or TDD.

TDD is an approach used by many companies, teams, and individuals that promotes development of software through the use of small tests that test for specific requirements of the software before any of the code is written for the software. This approach gives the team confidence to know that each line of code they write is useful and will get them closer to their end goal, a functional, non-buggy application.

Of course, you are still learning and will not be able to implement these high level procedures right from the beginning. Take this pressure off of yourself right now, and just know that you will get to TDD when you can. In the meantime, know that throughout this course you will be using repos that have unit tests built into each application. These tests are meant to test your application against real-world and edge-case scenarios. You can use these tests as guides when building your applications but also as templates to learn and build more tests. In fact, you will be asked to write multiple tests throughout this course and it is highly encouraged that you [learn as much about testing as possible](https://youtu.be/MLTRHc5dk6s) as this is a highly in-demand skill that will set you apart from other candidates during your job hunt.
