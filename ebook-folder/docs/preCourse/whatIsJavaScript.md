First off, JavaScript is nothing even close to Java. [Please do not confuse the two](https://medium.com/@benastontweet/lesson-1a-the-history-of-javascript-8c1ce3bffb17). The naming of JavaScript was a marketing tactic at the time of creation to make programmers feel comfortable with the new language and increase its popularity. In short, **Java is to JavaScript as car is to carpet**.

Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript (JS) is a programming language. Instead of rendering content and telling it how it should look, JavaScript can decide what will be rendered, when it will be rendered, why it will be rendered, how it will be rendered and how much of it to be rendered on the screen. JS can control the flow of elements, information, and interactions. Think of it this way: If HTML is the bones of your web page and CSS is the meat and fat that fleshes it out, then JS is the brains that control the movement and flow of everything on the web page.

At first, JS will seem daunting. In time you'll find it really isn't but because you've been working mostly in HTML and CSS it will feel overwhelming. I promise you it isn't and you will get it. But it will take a little bit of time and effort. Also, by learning JS you are simultaneously learning the fundamentals of programming which will make all other programming languages come easier later on. You're doing the hard work now!
