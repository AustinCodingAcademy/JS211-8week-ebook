# Practice Data Types and Functions

1. Create a new Repl.it called: dataTypesAndFunctions
2. Using the `console.log()` method, complete each of the following prompts.

    > Place the code you want to execute inside the `()`(**invocation parenthesis**), like so:

    ```javascript
      // subtract one number from another
      const firstNumber = 9;
      const secondNumber = 3;

      console.log(firstNumber - secondNumber);
    ```

1. Run the program to see what happens. Start using `console.log()` as you build all of your future projects to see expect outputs.
1. Make a variable called `name` and assign its value to be your name as a string
1. Make a variable called `userAge` and assign its value to be your age as a number
1. Create a function called `dividedBy`. It should take in any two numbers and return the result of the first number divided by the second.

    > HINT 1: Be sure to hold all of your values in a variable. When you hit "Run" ( ++cmd+enter++), the emulator will display the results on the right!
    > Hint 2: You will have to google how to do these. Go figure them out for yourself and have fun doing it!! If you don't know, try HackOverflow.

1. Display the current day and time in JavaScript.
1. Convert a Number, `7`, to a String, `"7"`, in JavaScript.
1. Convert a string, `"7"`, to the number, `7`, in JavaScript.
1. Add two numbers together in JavaScript.
1. Print out `"Both are TRUE"` only when 2 things are true.
1. Print out `"One of these is TRUE"` when 1 of 2 things are true.
1. Print out `"Neither is TRUE"` when both things are not true.
1. Create one variable for each of the following data types:
    * `Boolean` i.e. `const myBool = false;`
    * `Null`
    * `Undefined`
    * `Number`
    * `NaN`
    * `String`

1. Copy/paste the following variable, function declaration, and function invocation into your Repl.it:

  ```javascript
    // your variable
    const myBool = false;

    // function declaration
    const isTypeOf = (data) => {
      return console.log(typeof data);
    }

    // function invocation
    isTypeOf(myBool);

    // In the function invocation, replace "myBool" with the other names of your variables...isTypeOf(name); isTypeOf(divideBy);...etc.

    // What is happening?
  ```
