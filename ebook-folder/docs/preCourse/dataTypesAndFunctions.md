# Practice Data Types and Functions

- [ ] Create a new Repl.it called: dataTypesAndFunctions
- [ ] Using the `console.log()` method, complete each of the following prompts.

    > Place the code you want to execute inside the `()`(**invocation parenthesis**), like so:

    ```javascript
      // subtract one number from another
      const firstNumber = 9;
      const secondNumber = 3;

      console.log(firstNumber - secondNumber);
    ```

- [ ] Run the program to see what happens. Start using `console.log()` as you build all of your future projects to see expect outputs.
- [ ] Make a variable called `name` and assign its value to be your name as a string
- [ ] Make a variable called `userAge` and assign its value to be your age as a number
- [ ] Create a function called `dividedBy`. It should take in any two numbers and return the result of the first number divided by the second.

    > HINT 1: Be sure to hold all of your values in a variable. When you hit "Run" ( ++cmd+enter++), the emulator will display the results on the right!
    > Hint 2: You will have to google how to do these. Go figure them out for yourself and have fun doing it!! If you don't know, try HackOverflow.

- [ ] Display the current day and time in JavaScript.
- [ ] Convert a Number, `7`, to a String, `"7"`, in JavaScript.
- [ ] Convert a string, `"7"`, to the number, `7`, in JavaScript.
- [ ] Add two numbers together in JavaScript.
- [ ] Print out `"Both are TRUE"` only when 2 things are true.
- [ ] Print out `"One of these is TRUE"` when 1 of 2 things are true.
- [ ] Print out `"Neither is TRUE"` when both things are not true.
- [ ] Create one variable for each of the following data types:
    * `Boolean` i.e. `const myBool = false;`
    * `Null`
    * `Undefined`
    * `Number`
    * `NaN`
    * `String`

- [ ] Copy/paste the following variable, function declaration, and function invocation into your Repl.it:

  ```javascript
    // your variable
    const myBool = false;

    // function declaration
    const isTypeOf = (data) => {
      return console.log(typeof data);
    }

    // function invocation
    isTypeOf(myBool);

    // In the function invocation, replace "myBool" with the other names of your variables...isTypeOf(name); isTypeOf(divideBy);...etc.

    // What is happening?
  ```
