# Welcome to JS211 - Foundations in Programming

## Objective Statement

Through this course students will learn to program by building simple and basic applications. The focus of this course is programmatic logic with a secondary focus on syntax. This course uses JavaScript as a language/syntax and Node.js as an environment to run JavaScript outside of a web browser. The skills learned in this course directly translate to other programming languages.

While client-facing **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterfaces (GUIs) are recommended as extended practice, there is no need for a student to worry if they are unable to build a GUI for every one of their terminal-based applications(CLI). In this course, students get a real chance to develop their own problem-solving strategies. There is no one right way to do any of them. In addition, the skills learned in this course directly translate to the skills learned in the 311 and 411 courses in a more practical and realistic sense. Instead of learning various methods, programming patterns, and data manipulation in isolation, students will spread their understanding and familiarity with programming over the development of their graduation app in the following 311 and 411 courses.

Our philosophy is "learn by doing". We engage our students in the problem solving process as opposed to relying heavily on lectures. Our instructors, who are real developers, facilitate learning through guiding your progress as you work through projects on your own.

To be successful in this course, you must spend 10-15 hours outside of class completing Pre-Class Lessons before each Class Lesson. Our class structure follows the flipped classroom model where students learn on their own outside of class and bring their questions with them to class. Class begins by discussing the "Questions for Discussion & Terms to Know", and the majority of class time is spent working on projects.

READ ON, start with Pre-Course Pt 1: How to Succeed and work through all 5 sections BEFORE you come to class on the first day!

## Class Structure and Expectations

This class will follow a Flipped-Classroom methodology. This means you, the student, are required to complete the assigned Pre-Homework before each day of class. You will not succeed in this course if you don't complete the Pre-Homework. Working on the Pre-Homework during class takes away from other students, ruins your chance to deeply understand the material, and ask import questions! Don't be the guy!

* **Due dates**: Homework is due the **Sunday** after it is assigned. (unless otherwise specified). Please have your assignment turned in by the end of Sunday night. Due dates are scheduled on Sunday for you to attend Study Sessions on the weekend. GET IT DONE!

    * Both Daily and Checkpoint Assignments are due the Sunday after they are assigned, the **Submission Due Day**, i.e. *Ticket-Counter is assigned Wednesday and will be due for submission 4 days later on Sunday.*
    * Assignments turned in after the **Submission Due Day** will be penalized with -20 points, in other words, only a maximum grade of 80 is possible.
    * The third Checkpoint for each course, (101 - 411) will be due the Sunday following the last day of the course. Work turned in after this will be subject to -20 penalty.
    * The **Final Submission Day** for any late assignments is the Second Sunday after each course ends.
    * Assignments turned in after the **Final Submission Day** will receive an automatic grade of 50.

* **Homework submission**: Turn in your homework on Canvas. Copy/paste a link to your completed assignment(GitHub Pull Request or repo URL) in the designated spot for the assignment. For assignments that cannot be accessed via link, we'll make other arrangements on a case-by-case basis.

* **Homework guidelines**: Your work should be thorough and demonstrate an understanding of the topic and tasks set forth. Please make sure that your assignments are detailed with comments, inclusive of all specifications, and complete.

* **Grading**: You Instructor will be grading your assignments based on their functionality and completion of the specifications laid out for each assignment.

* **Late policy**: You may receive up to a 70 for an assignment that is turned in late. It is up to you, the student, to request the instructor grade the assignment after you have submitted it. Additionally, if you have 3 late or missing assignments in a row, you'll be asked to read a programming-related article of your choice and make a 3-minute presentation about it to the class.

* **Exceptions**: If you need to turn in an assignment late or will be tardy/absent to a class please email your Instructor and Campus Director ahead of time to make appropriate arrangements.

## To Pass This Class (and all others)

* Finish with a grade average of >70,
* Attend class 80% of the time,
* Complete your Final Checkpoint,
* Present to the class specs for the app you are planning to build for your Capstone Project.
