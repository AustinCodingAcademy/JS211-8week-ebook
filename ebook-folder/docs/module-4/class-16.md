## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

### Part 1: Lodash

You've used `dotenv` already so you know about Node and npm. Now bring in this npm module and learn to use it. Yes, it will be a little challenging because you've never worked with this module before but often times interviews will go like this. You don't really know the library but they ask you about it, you've probably heard about it and now you're going to figure out how to use it.

- [ ] While pair-programming, create a new repo: "Lodash-Practice".
- [ ] `git clone` the repo.
- [ ] Then use `npm init` to initialize the repo for Node.
- [ ] Hit ++enter++ multiple times to generate an empty and basic package.json.
- [ ] [Install](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) lodash.
- [ ] Use this [blog on lodash](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/01/12/common-javascript-functions-with-lodash/) to understand the power.
- [ ] Use the [lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.10).
- [ ] Use this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdfikit351Y) to see how to use lodash.
- [ ] Build a simple terminal app that uses at least 5 lodash methods.
    - [ ]  Use fake data or APIs you have worked with in previous projects or google fake data you can use. - [ ]  Either make a fetch or save it in a few variables.
    - [ ]  Console.log the output of each lodash method called on the fake data.
    - [ ]  Use at least these methods: `_.chunk()`, `_.reverse()`, `_.without()`, `_.shuffle()`.
    - [ ]  Create unit tests with Mocha for each function you build.

  > TIP: use the data from day 11 for arrays and objects to tinker with. Or google fake data.

### Part 2: Recursion, find GCD

In a new Repl.it called: GCD-Recursion

Write a recursive JavaScript program to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive numbers. Example: `findGCD(25, 20) // => 5 findGCD(50, 20) // => 10`

#### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Continue on! After you finish these five, switch roles—navigator is now the driver and the driver is now the navigator.
- [ ] Create 5 more inputs, buttons and displays for 5 more lodash methods.
- [ ] Create unit tests for each of your functions.
