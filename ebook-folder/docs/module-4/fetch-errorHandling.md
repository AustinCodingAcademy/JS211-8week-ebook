# Error Handing with Fetch

One of the downsides to using fetch is that it doesn't have proper error handling. This is one of the reasons we use isomorphic-fetch or Axios, which we will get to next class. For now, we're going to have to figure out a way around error handling because you'll be working with a new API tomorrow and you will almost certainly type in the wrong characters. For this you will want error handling to give you a neat and tidy error message to help you debug. *REMEMBER*: **error messages are good!!**

## Practice It - Error Handling

**HEY!! You MUST do these practice problems before class!!!**

- [ ] Go back to your [practice problem](https://studio.zollege.com/jump_to_id/d475ee0d7e0d4fa6a723266694aa0a0b) from the last homework and add error handling to it.
- [ ] Use this code to get started:
- [ ] Push Yourself Further: Can you separate your error handling into a separate function as you saw in the video before?

```javascript
  const getPosts = () => {
    fetch('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
    .then(res => {
      if(!res.ok) {
        throw Error(res.statusText)
      } return res.json()
    })
    .then(posts => arrayOfPosts = posts)
    .catch(err => console.log(`Error,  ${err}`))
  }
```

- [ ] Make sure you add error handling to all your requests in the practice problem.
- [ ] Intentionally break your fetch URL to test your error handling. Hint: simply changing one character in the URL will break the fetch and return and error.
