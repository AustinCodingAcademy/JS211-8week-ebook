# Testing Fetch and Dependency Injection

<!-- *STARLING QUOTE -Author* -->

By now, you're pretty familiar with building unit tests for your apps. Today we're going to cover how to use dependency injection to create unit tests for your `fetch` requests so that you can then bring it into your current API-consuming app.

## See Dependency Injection

## Practice Fetch Testing

- [ ] Create a new repo called: "Fetch-Unit-Testing"
- [ ] Clone the repo into your jsDev folder(directory)
- [ ] `npm init` ++enter++, ++enter++, ++enter++, ++enter++, ++enter++...
- [ ] `npm install -g mocha`
- [ ] Build a simple GUI app that uses this api: [https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2)
- [ ] Use the previous video to walk through building two tests for this simple app; 1 for a single beer and 1 for 10 beers
- [ ] You should end up with a simple GUI app that has at least two unit tests *injected* into your fetch request
