If you worked on the practice problem in the pre-work you should have a firm grasp of an API and how to request data from it. Today we're going to build an address book using a free API as our server of data.

In pairs, create a list of users and display their info:

- [ ] Read these instructions and understand the requirements FIRST
- [ ] Whiteboard your app
- [ ] Make a code plan
- [ ] Pseudo code and then translate to JavaScript
- [ ] Create a new repo (name it descriptively well), clone it to your local machine and share it with your partner
- [ ] Open the directory and create an `index.html` and `main.js` file to fetch a user and display them one at at time
- [ ] Use the API: `https://randomuser.me/api/` to fetch a user now
- [ ] Fetch a new user multiple times and store them in an array
- [ ] Then list out all the users in your address book array by name and picture
- [ ] [Figure out](https://randomuser.me/documentation) how to fetch multiple users in one fetch request
- [ ] Fetch multiple users on window load
- [ ] Add a button to each user that when clicked displays the rest of their information like `DOB`, `address` and so forth
- [ ] Once you have the functionality working, feel free to style and structure your address book with CSS and HTML

**YOU KNOW HOW TO DO ALL OF THIS BY NOW. TRUST YOURSELF!!**

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Display your users alphabetically
- [ ] Add another button to hide the information
- [ ] Request only users from AU, then US, then FR and then GB
- [ ] Figure out how to only request name, picture and cell
- [ ] Figure out how to exclude: dob, registered, nationality, location

- [ ] ABSOLUTELY THE LAST THING YOU SHOULD DO:
    * [ ] Style your address book with some flare by adding a CSS file
