## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

We've done a lot of programming by ourselves but rarely do we program in a bubble alone. Most of the time we are usually working with a team. Today you are going to choose an app you want to build, pair up with someone based on your mutual interests, create a repo, clone it to each of your machines, work in separate branches and collaborate to figure out the docs of the API you choose and the layout and style of the app you want to build.

- [ ] Choose an app you want to build
- [ ] Pair up with someone based on your interests
- [ ] Create a repo using your template
- [ ] Clone it to one of your machines
    - [ ]  `npm init`
    - [ ]  Understand [dotenv](https://youtu.be/zDup0I2VGmk){:target="_blank"}
    - [ ]  `npm install dotenv --save`
    - [ ]  `require('dotenv').config()` at the top of your `main.js`
    - [ ]  create a `.gitignore` file in the root folder
    - [ ]  add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file
    - [ ]  create a `.env` in the root folder and save your API key in it by...
    - [ ]  adding something like `SECRET_KEY=abcd1234` to the `.env` file
- [ ] `git` `add` `commit` `push`...
- [ ] Now clone it to your partner's machine
- [ ] Repeat the .env file process so each of you have a copy of the API key
- [ ] Work in separate branches (be careful of merge conflicts)
- [ ] Focus on functionality first
- [ ] Only style after you have all the functionality working
- [ ] The projects can become a final project if you like. You can continue building them on your own or together. In class, however, we are just going to focus on accessing the API and doing a few simple things with the data we get back.

### Prompts

#### Brewery App

- [ ] Read the [Brewery API](https://www.brewerydb.com/developers) documentation.
- [ ] Build an app that allows a user to find breweries near them.
- [ ] Remember the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) you learned in 101!
- [ ] Allow users to "heart" their favorite places.

<!-- #### Star Wars Trivia Game

[https://www.swapi.dev](https://swapi.dev/)

Build a game that can challenge two users to answer questions about Star Wars.
If they get it right they get a point added to their side. (Use the logic from your TicTacToe game to get an idea of how to switch users). -->

#### Pokemon Collection

- [ ] Read the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) documentation.
- [ ] Create an arena that displays two Pokemon battling each other.
- [ ] Compare the two to see who is likely to win.

#### Marvel Character Look-Up

- [ ] Read the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started) documentation
- [ ] Sign up for an api key
- [ ] Create a collector catalog of all the characters a person has/wants to collect.

### Push Yourself Further

- [ ] Find [more APIs](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3wrswc/what_are_some_fun_apis_to_play_with/) to spark your imagination.
- [ ] Check out this [API](https://rapidapi.com/) of APIs!
