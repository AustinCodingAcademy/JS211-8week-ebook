# Develop Series: Music for Your Brain

If you haven't already started finding music to help you focus your attention in on the problem at hand, now's your chance. Just like working or cleaning the house is always made better and easier with music, so is coding! Having the right rhythm to think and type to can contribute so much to your efficiency as a programmer. While finding music can be a daunting task, using a few focused searches can help you narrow in on the best music for you. My personal favorite is the Focus tracks on [Brain.fm](https://brain.fm/). It's an app that offers a variety of 2 hour tracks of binaural sounds, each with a beginning, middle and end, to help you focus, meditate, relax, recharge and sleep. It has a monthly membership but in my experience with it so far, it is worth way more than I pay! I can code for hours with the focus tracks and sleep peacefully with the relax tracks.
