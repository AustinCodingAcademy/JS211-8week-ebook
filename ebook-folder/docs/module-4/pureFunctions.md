# Pure Functions or Why FP?

## Why Functional Programming

So we've been dabbling in functional programming for a bit. If it's still a little strange and hard to figure out, that's okay. You'll get it a little more each time you work at it. However today we're going to explore what functional programming allows for JavaScript to do, which is Node—or a giant library of libraries (nodes). Each of these nodes are chunks of code we can bring into our apps to use without having to have built it ourselves. The power is near endless and we will play with one of the best ones today. But before we get too far, I need you to read these last two blogs on functional programming: [Part 3](https://hackernoon.com/javascript-and-functional-programming-pt-3-pure-functions-d572bb52e21c) and [Part 4](https://hackernoon.com/javascript-and-functional-programming-currying-pt-4-96e3230782ab).

### Pure Functions

As you saw in the Part 3 blog of the FP series, [pure functions](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976) have two rules:

  > 1. A pure function is [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm). If given the same input, the function will always return the same output.
  > 2. A pure function will not cause [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)). A side effect is any change in the system that is visible.

Granted, we haven't been building large applications yet and most of our functions have been pure without us even knowing what a pure function is. So why talk about it? Well, for two reasons: 1) you need to think about building your apps with pure functions to limit your bugs and make it easier to read and think about and 2) because pure functions are how Node modules are built!

Yes, through the use of functional programming, libraries are built as pure functions which can be short and reusable so they can be *curried* or called *recursively*. Really and truly, this functional programming is awesome! It opens up so many possibilities like React, Redux, Node backends and lodash, along with all the other libraries in Node. Don't worry, we'll get to all the stuff in the next course, but for now we're going to get used to bringing in someone else's code and using it for ourselves.
