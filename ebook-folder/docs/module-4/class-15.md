*OBJECTIVE: By re-engaging with previously learned knowledge and applying it to a new challenge the student will deepen their understanding and be prepared to creatively reuse these techniques in new ways.*

### Questions for Student Led Discussion, 15 mins
<!-- This section should be structured with the 5E model: https://lesley.edu/article/empowering-students-the-5e-model-explained -->

### Interview Challenge, 15 mins
<!-- The last two E happen here: elaborate and evaluate  -->
<!-- this sections should have a challenge that can be solved with the skills they've learned since their last class. -->

### Part 1: Testing Your Fetch

Last week you paired up and built an app that fetches data from an API. Today you're going to add unit tests for multiple situations:

- [ ] Mistyped address
- [ ] Out of range request
- [ ] Wrong API key
- [ ] *Hypothetical 4*
- [ ] *Hypothetical 5*

#### Instructions

- [ ] Pair up with your partner again
- [ ] `git status` to make sure you each have pushed up and merge all of your changes
- [ ] Work on one computer and add the 5 unit tests mentioned. You will have to refactor your request a bit to add in `fetch` as a dependency

### Part 2: Recursive Exponent

In a Repl.it called Exponent of Number - Recursively

- [ ] Write a recursive JavaScript program to compute the exponent of any number given. 

  > Note: The exponent of a number says how many times the base number is used as a factor.

- [ ] Example: If you were given the number 64: `8 ** 2 = 8 x 8 = 64`. Here `8` is the base and `2` is the exponent.

- [ ] Turn in the URL.

### Part 3: Recursive Sum of Array

In a new Repl.it called Sum of Array - Recursively

- [ ] Write a recursive JavaScript program to compute the sum of an array of integers.
- [ ] Example : `const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] sumArr(array1) // => Expected Output : 21`
- [ ] Turn in the URL.
