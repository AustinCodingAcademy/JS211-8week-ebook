# Class 1: JavaScript Review

*The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. —Walt Disney*

## Greet, Outline, and Objectify

Since we don't know each other, at least, not your instructor, everyone should answer these questions aloud:

1. Hi, my name is ...
2. I currently work as a ... but I love to spend my time ...
3. I'm excited about learning to program because ...
4. My best time to do a study group or tutoring is ... (example: Mondays in the afternoon.)

Today we're going to:
  
*Review and reinforce our understanding of the JavaScript language by building and running an application within the Node runtime environment*

### Daily Student Presentations Overview & Organization

While learning to code is pretty important if you want to code for work, so is learning to talk about code! To do this, you must first know something about code. Secondly, you have to know something about talking to people in one-on-one chats, group conversations and team presentations. This is a necessary skill and will be a major part of your future interviews. To get us all prepped and ready to talk about our code, we're going to be practicing talking to the class about shortcuts and tool efficiency. It's one thing to know how to code and it's another to know how to use your computer's keyboard, text editor and terminal well. Wow your interviewers with your sharp fingers and grow your class's skill with these presentations! Today we will assign people to the remaining days of class to present for 5-7 minutes ONLY, at the beginning of class, on the pre-assigned topic.

[All student presentation topics are listed here](./../additionalResources/studentPresentations.md). Take the time now to select, plan, and record what day you're presenting. Next class one-third of the class will give a four-minute pitch of their planned Capstone App they intend to build by the end of 411.

**Prompt**

  > Pitch your Capstone App to the class. What’s the problem? How does this app solve it?

Through the next week the other two-thirds of the class will follow suit and present a four-minute pitch over their Capstone App!!

### Questions for Student Led Discussion, 15 mins

## Creation Time, 60-90 minutes

1. Let's take a look at the [JS211-CurrentDate Repo](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/JS211_CurrentDateTimeProject.git)

- [ ]  Did anyone not finish it?
- [ ]  Let's walk through it one by one starting from the `package.json` file.
- [ ]  Did anyone not get it pushed up to their gitHub account?

2. Use your knowledge of HTML and CSS to bring the functionality of these code blocks to the DOM

- [ ]  Go to the index.html file and see how the file is connected to main.js.
- [ ]  Follow the pattern to bring your JavaScript solutions to the DOM for a user to see visually.
- [ ]  `git status`
- [ ]  `git add main.js index.html`
- [ ]  `git status`
- [ ]  `git commit -m "Solutions are fixed and showing in the DOM"`
- [ ]  `git push`
- [ ]  Turn the URL of this this repo in to be graded.
