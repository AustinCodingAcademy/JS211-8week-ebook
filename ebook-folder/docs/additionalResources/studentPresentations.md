# Daily Student Presentations

## The Purpose

In order to develop our students' communication skills around software development, each student will plan, practice, and teach to the class on a subject listed here and in the home page of this textbook. The subject may be a little obscure or only slightly related to the current topic. But the second objective for these presentations is to open the minds of all the students to things we don't have enough time to cover in these short weeks together.

Students should prepare in advance and take their responsibility to the class and themselves seriously. Take this time now to decide and record who will present starting next class, Day 2, through Day 16, 15 classes total. It is suggested the instructor use GoogleSheets to organize and share the information with students.

Feel empowered to write blogs, make a video, create a diagram(s), and develop code bases for your presentations effectiveness.
