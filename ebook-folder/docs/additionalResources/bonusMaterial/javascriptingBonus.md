# Bonus Challenge: Javascripting.js

By now you've covered the main parts of JavaScript. There are still some [weird parts](https://youtu.be/Bv_5Zv5c-Ts) that you should get to know but we've covered a lot of ground and have definitely got ourselves to a higher order of functionality in our coding abilities. To make sure we solidify our understanding of programming and JavaScript as a coding language you're going to install [Javascripting.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/javascripting) and work through each of the tasks in the program.

- [ ] Open your terminal
- [ ] run `npm install --global javascripting`
  > if that doesn't work try: sudo npm install --global javascripting (type in your computer's password)
- [ ] After it's installed navigate to your jsdev folder or wherever you want to build this practice problem.
- [ ] Then run javascripting in the folder you'd like.
- [ ] Go to "Introduction" and hit ENTER.
- [ ] You'll then make a directory to hold these new files in: mkdir javascripting-practice
- [ ] Work through the directions to complete each challenge.
- [ ] If you get lost, there's a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ9nVsoRYLTRtLOCYH-wzjsvcIqz2kPOf) over NodeSchool's JavaScripting course.
