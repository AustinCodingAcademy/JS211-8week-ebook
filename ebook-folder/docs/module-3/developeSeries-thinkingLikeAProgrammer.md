# Develop Series: Thinking Like a Programmer

Now that you've been in coding school for a while, I hope you've learned there is a difference between coding and programming. If not, check back on your pre-course work. As you develop your coding skills it's very important to develop your programming skills. You need to be able to walk through tasks one at a time to make the most of your coding skills. If you can't problem-solve you can't use code! What a dilemma!

Luckily the problem solving skills can be developed just like a muscle. Your brain now is wired to do well at the tasks it's used to doing. If you're a server it's good at memorizing menu items, prices and locations of menu item buttons in your POS and managing customer relations at a table. If you're a teacher your brain is geared to manage behaviors, inspire students, develop lesson plans, walk fine lines with angry parents and project manage your entire calendar year while balancing grading, administration demands and hopefully life at home. ;) There are many other jobs you might have, and each of them has a unique skill set your brain has grown to be good at. As a developer, all of those skills will come in handy, but you must also ask your brain to train for new tasks. Problem solving with code!
