# Algorithms Part Two

*I attribute my success to this: I never gave or took any excuse. —Florence Nightingale*

## Overview

Solving problems is what developers do. We figure out how to make things work. Today we're going to work on a few challenges in preparation for our class tomorrow. Make sure you work on all three challenges in separate Repl.its. There are videos for each but you won't know you can do it until you do it by yourself. Once you've whiteboarded, code planned and coded it along with a video, REDO it by yourself. Continue the process for everything you do. We learn from other developers, we do it for ourselves and then we teach others. It's the cycle we live in. BE SURE TO WHITEBOARD EVERY SOLUTION BEFORE YOU CODE IT!! This is incredibly important!!

### Remove Duplicates

In a new Repl.it:

Create a function that removes duplicate numbers from an array.

### Longest Sub-Sequence

In a new Repl.it:

**Given an array of N numbers, find the length of the longest subset of sorted increasing numbers.**

  > NOTE: N just means the length of the array could be anything.

```javascript
  const myArr = [3, 1, 2, 7, 10, 8, 11, 9] 

  longestSubSet(myArr) // => 5

  // because, in order, 1, 2, 7, 8 and 9 are the longest ascending subset in the array.
```

### Length of Longest Alternating Sub-Array

In a new Repl.it:

**Given an array of N arrays including positive and negative numbers only, find the length of the longest alternating (meaning negative-positive-negative or positive-negative-positive) sub array present in the array.**
