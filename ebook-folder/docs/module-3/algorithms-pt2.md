## Thinking Like a Programmer

Now that you've been in coding school for a while, I hope you've learned there is a difference between coding and programming. If not, check back on your pre-course work. As you develop your coding skills it's very important to develop your programming skills. You need to be able to walk through tasks one at a time to make the most of your coding skills. If you can't problem-solve you can't use code! What a dilemma!

Luckily the problem solving skills can be developed just like a muscle. Your brain now is wired to do well at the tasks it's used to doing. If you're a server it's good at memorizing menu items, prices and locations of menu item buttons in your POS and managing customer relations at a table. If you're a teacher your brain is geared to manage behaviors, inspire students, develop lesson plans, walk fine lines with angry parents and project manage your entire calendar year while balancing grading, administration demands and hopefully life at home. ;) There are many other jobs you might have, and each of them has a unique skill set your brain has grown to be good at. As a developer, all of those skills will come in handy, but you must also ask your brain to train for new tasks. Problem solving with code!

## Overview

Solving problems is what developers do. We figure out how to make things work. Today we're going to work on a few challenges in preparation for our class tomorrow. Make sure you work on all three challenges in separate Repl.its. There are videos for each but you won't know you can do it until you do it by yourself. Once you've whiteboarded, code planned and coded it along with a video, REDO it by yourself. Continue the process for everything you do. We learn from other developers, we do it for ourselves and then we teach others. It's the cycle we live in. BE SURE TO WHITEBOARD EVERY SOLUTION BEFORE YOU CODE IT!! This is incredibly important!!

### Remove Duplicates

In a new Repl.it:

Create a function that removes duplicate numbers from an array.

### Longest Sub-Sequence

In a new Repl.it:

**Given an array of N numbers, find the length of the longest subset of sorted increasing numbers.**

  > NOTE: N just means the length of the array could be anything.


```javascript
  const myArr = [3, 1, 2, 7, 10, 8, 11, 9] 

  longestSubSet(myArr) // => 5

  // because, in order, 1, 2, 7, 8 and 9 are the longest ascending subset in the array.
```

### Length of Longest Alternating Sub-Array

In a new Repl.it:

**Given an array of N arrays including positive and negative numbers only, find the length of the longest alternating (meaning negative-positive-negative or positive-negative-positive) sub array present in the array.**
