## Creation Time, 60-90 mins

### Part 1: Git and BankAccount Review

Instructor led discussion over Git and BankAccount

### Part 2: Functional Programming Rebuild

By now you should very much know how to build higher-order functions from scratch. Today you will warm-up on the more important and useful higher order functions: `.map()`, `.reduce()` and `.filter()`.

- [ ] Whiteboard, make a code plan and build each of the following methods:
    - [ ]  `.map()` - function that takes an array of items and a function that returns an array with each item manipulated by that function.
    - [ ]  `.reduce()` - function that takes an array of food orders with their amounts and returns the total amount of all the food orders.
    - [ ]  `.filter()` - function that takes an array of items and a function that returns an array with only the items that return true in the function.
- [ ] Create a repo called "Higher-Order-From-Scratch".
- [ ] Practice working from branches by creating a new branch called: "HigherOrder".
- [ ] Place your code in a file called `main.js`.
- [ ] Create a pull request (PR) for `Higher-Order-From-Scratch` to be merged into `master`.

### Part 3: Sorting
